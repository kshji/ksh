# Ksh/bash scripts for using #

I have done lot of stuff using ksh/awk/sed ... today it's more hoppy.

I try to tell for less ksh used persons how powerfull scripting language it's.

Why I like it ? Only some commands but enough. No librarys or plugins. Static bin include everything.
Nice HERE template.

Thanks for Bourne Shell and Korn Shell. All posix-sh are nice (ksh, bash, dash, ...), but for
scripting I have used ksh93.
