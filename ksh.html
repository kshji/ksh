<DIV class=FI>
<EM>Ksh&nbsp;</EM>
is a command and programming language
that executes commands read from a terminal
or a file.
<EM>Rksh&nbsp;</EM>
is a restricted version of the
command interpreter
<EM>ksh</EM>;
it is used to set up login names and execution environments whose
capabilities are more controlled than those of the standard shell.
<EM>Rpfksh&nbsp;</EM>
is a profile shell version of the
command interpreter
<EM>ksh</EM>;
it is used to to execute commands with the attributes specified by
the user's profiles (see
<NOBR><A href="../man1/pfexec.html"><EM>pfexec</EM></A>(1)).</NOBR>
See
<EM>Invocation&nbsp;</EM>
below
for the meaning of arguments to the shell.
<P>
<H5><A name="Definitions">Definitions</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
A
<EM>metacharacter&nbsp;</EM>
is one of the following characters:
<P>
<DIV class=FI>
<STRONG>;   &amp;   (   )   |   &lt;   &gt;   new-line   space   tab</STRONG>
</DIV>
<BR>
<P>
A
<EM>blank&nbsp;</EM>
is a
<STRONG>tab</STRONG>
or a
<STRONG>space</STRONG>.
An
<EM>identifier&nbsp;</EM>
is a sequence of letters, digits, or underscores
starting with a letter or underscore.
Identifiers are used as components of
<EM>variable&nbsp;</EM>
names.
A
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
is a sequence of one or more identifiers
separated by a <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG> and optionally preceded
by a <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG>.
Vnames are used as function and variable names.
A
<EM>word&nbsp;</EM>
is a sequence of
<EM>characters&nbsp;</EM>
from the character set defined by the current locale,
excluding non-quoted
<EM>metacharacters</EM>.
<P>
A
<EM>command&nbsp;</EM>
is a sequence of characters in the syntax
of the shell language.
The shell reads each command and
carries out the desired action either directly or by invoking
separate utilities.
A built-in command is a command that is carried out by the
shell itself without creating a separate process.
Some commands are built-in purely for convenience
and are not documented here.
Built-ins that cause
side effects in the shell environment and
built-ins that are found before performing a
path search (see
<EM>Execution&nbsp;</EM>
below)
are documented here.
For historical reasons, some of
these built-ins behave differently than
other built-ins and are called
<EM>special built-ins</EM>.
<P>
</DIV>
<H5><A name="Commands">Commands</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
A
<EM>simple-command&nbsp;</EM>
is a list of variable assignments
(see
<EM>Variable Assignments&nbsp;</EM>
below)
or a sequence of
<EM>blank&nbsp;</EM>
separated words
which may be preceded by a list of variable assignments
(see
<EM>Environment&nbsp;</EM>
below).
The first word specifies the name of the command to
be executed.
Except as specified below,
the remaining words are passed as arguments
to the invoked command.
The command name is passed as argument 0
(see
<NOBR><A href="../man2/exec.html"><EM>exec</EM></A>(2)).</NOBR>
The
<EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
of a simple-command is its exit status; 0-255
if it terminates normally; 256+<EM>signum&nbsp;</EM> if
it terminates abnormally (the name of the signal corresponding
to the exit status can be
obtained via the
<STRONG>&#45;l</STRONG>
option of the
<STRONG>kill&nbsp;</STRONG>
built-in utility).
<P>
A
<EM>pipeline&nbsp;</EM>
is a sequence of one or more
<EM>commands&nbsp;</EM>
separated by
<STRONG>|</STRONG>.
The standard output of each command but the last
is connected by a
<NOBR><A href="../man2/pipe.html"><EM>pipe</EM></A>(2)</NOBR>
to the standard input of the next command.
Each command,
except possibly the last,
is run as a separate process;
the shell waits for the last command to terminate.
The exit status of a pipeline is the exit
status of the last command unless the
<STRONG>pipefail</STRONG>
option is enabled.
Each pipeline can be preceded by the
<EM>reserved word</EM>
<STRONG>!</STRONG>
which causes the exit status of the pipeline to become
0 if the exit status of the last command is non-zero, and
1 if the exit status of the last command is 0.
<P>
A
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
is a sequence of one or more
pipelines
separated by
<STRONG>;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>|&amp;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&amp;&amp;</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>|&nbsp;|</STRONG>,
and optionally terminated by
<STRONG>;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>|&amp;</STRONG>.
Of these five symbols,
<STRONG>;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>,
and
<STRONG>|&amp;</STRONG>
have equal precedence,
which is lower than that of
<STRONG>&amp;&amp;</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>|&nbsp;|</STRONG>.
The symbols
<STRONG>&amp;&amp;</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>|&nbsp;|</STRONG>
also have equal precedence.
A semicolon
(<STRONG>;</STRONG>)
causes sequential execution of the preceding pipeline; an ampersand
(<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>)
causes asynchronous execution of the preceding pipeline (i.e., the shell does
<EM>not&nbsp;</EM>
wait for that pipeline to finish).
The symbol
<STRONG>|&amp;</STRONG>
causes asynchronous execution of the preceding pipeline
with a two-way pipe established to the parent shell;
the standard input and output of the spawned pipeline
can be written to and read from by the parent shell
by applying
the redirection operators
<STRONG>&lt;&amp;</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>&gt;&amp;</STRONG>
with arg
<STRONG>p</STRONG>
to commands and by using
<STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG>
option of
the built-in commands
<STRONG>read</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>print</STRONG>
described later.
The symbol
<STRONG>&amp;&amp;</STRONG>
(&nbsp;<STRONG>|&nbsp;|</STRONG>&nbsp;)
causes the
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
following it to be executed only if the preceding
pipeline
returns a zero (non-zero) value.
One or more new-lines may appear in a
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
instead of a semicolon,
to delimit a command.
The first
<EM>item &nbsp;</EM>
of the first
<EM>pipeline&nbsp;</EM>
of a
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
that is a simple command not beginning
with a redirection, and not occurring within a
<STRONG>while</STRONG>,
<STRONG>until</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>if</STRONG>
<EM>list</EM>,
can be preceded by a semicolon.
This semicolon
is ignored unless the
<STRONG>showme</STRONG>
option is enabled as described with
the
<STRONG>set</STRONG>
built-in below.
<P>
A
<EM>command&nbsp;</EM>
is either a simple-command
or one of the following.
Unless otherwise stated,
the value returned by a command is that of the
last simple-command executed in the command.
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>for</STRONG> <EM>vname&nbsp;</EM> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>in</STRONG> <EM>word&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093; <STRONG>;do</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;done</STRONG><DD><BR>
Each time a
<STRONG>for</STRONG>
command is executed,
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
is set to the next
<EM>word&nbsp;</EM>
taken from the
<STRONG>in</STRONG>
<EM>word&nbsp;</EM>
list.
If
<STRONG>in</STRONG><EM> word&nbsp;</EM>
<!--NULL-->.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
is omitted, then
the
<STRONG>for</STRONG>
command executes the <STRONG>do</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> once for each positional parameter
that is set starting from
<STRONG>1</STRONG>
(see
<EM>Parameter Expansion&nbsp;</EM>
below).
Execution ends when there are no more words in the list.
<DT><STRONG>for ((</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp;<EM>expr1&nbsp;</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; <STRONG>;</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp;<EM>expr2&nbsp;</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; <STRONG>;</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp;<EM>expr3&nbsp;</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; <STRONG>))</STRONG> <STRONG>;do</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;done</STRONG><DD><BR>
The arithmetic expression
<EM>expr1</EM>
is evaluated first
(see
<EM>Arithmetic evaluation</EM>
below).
The arithmetic expression
<EM>expr2</EM>
is repeatedly evaluated until it evaluates to zero and when non-zero,
<EM>list</EM>
is executed and the arithmetic expression
<EM>expr3</EM>
evaluated.
If any expression
is omitted, then it behaves as if it evaluated to 1.
<DT><STRONG>select</STRONG> <EM>vname&nbsp;</EM> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>in</STRONG> <EM>word&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093; <STRONG>;do</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;done</STRONG><DD><BR>
A
<STRONG>select</STRONG>
command prints on standard error (file descriptor 2) the set of
<EM>word</EM>s,
each preceded by a number.
If
<STRONG>in</STRONG><EM> word&nbsp;</EM>
<!--NULL-->.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
is omitted, then
the
positional parameters starting from
<STRONG>1</STRONG>
are used instead
(see
<EM>Parameter Expansion&nbsp;</EM>
below).
The
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PS3</STRONG></FONT>
prompt is printed
and a line is read from the standard input.
If this line consists of the number
of one of the listed
<EM>word</EM>s,
then the value of the variable
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
is set to the
<EM>word&nbsp;</EM>
corresponding to this number.
If this line is empty, the selection list is
printed again.
Otherwise the value of the variable
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
is set to
<EM>null</EM>.
The contents of the line read from standard input is
saved in
the variable
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>REPLY</STRONG>.</FONT>
The
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
is executed for each selection until a
<STRONG>break&nbsp;</STRONG>
or
<EM>end-of-file&nbsp;</EM>
is encountered.
If the
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>REPLY</STRONG></FONT>
variable is set to
<EM>null&nbsp;</EM>
by the execution of
<EM>list</EM>,
then the selection list is printed before
displaying the
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PS3</STRONG></FONT>
prompt for the next selection.
<DT><STRONG>case</STRONG> <EM>word&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>in</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; &#0091;&nbsp;<STRONG>(</STRONG>&nbsp;&#0093;<EM>pattern&nbsp;</EM> &#0091;&nbsp; | <EM>pattern&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <STRONG>)</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;;</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <STRONG>esac</STRONG><DD><BR>
A
<STRONG>case</STRONG>
command executes the
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
associated with the first
<EM>pattern&nbsp;</EM>
that matches
<EM>word</EM>.
The form of the patterns is
the same as that used for
file-name generation (see
<EM>File Name Generation&nbsp;</EM>
below).
The
<STRONG>;;</STRONG>
operator causes execution of
<STRONG>case</STRONG>
to terminate.
If
<STRONG>;&amp;</STRONG>
is used in place of
<STRONG>;;</STRONG>
the next subsequent list, if any,  is executed.
<DT><STRONG>if</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;then</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>;elif</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;then</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>;else</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093; <STRONG>;f<!--NULL-->i</STRONG><DD><BR>
The
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
following <STRONG>if</STRONG> is executed and,
if it
returns a zero exit status, the
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
following
the first
<STRONG>then</STRONG>
is executed.
Otherwise, the
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
following <STRONG>elif</STRONG>
is executed and, if its value is zero,
the
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
following
the next
<STRONG>then</STRONG>
is executed.
Failing each successive
<STRONG>elif</STRONG>
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>,
the
<STRONG>else</STRONG>
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
is executed.
If the
<STRONG>if</STRONG>
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
has non-zero exit status
and there is no
<STRONG>else</STRONG>
<EM>list</EM>,
then the
<STRONG>if</STRONG>
command returns a zero exit status.
<DT><STRONG>while</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;do</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;done</STRONG><DD><BR>
<DT><STRONG>until</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;do</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;done</STRONG><DD><BR>
A
<STRONG>while</STRONG>
command repeatedly executes the
<STRONG>while</STRONG>
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
and, if the exit status of the last command in the list is zero, executes
the
<STRONG>do</STRONG>
<EM>list</EM>;
otherwise the loop terminates.
If no commands in the
<STRONG>do</STRONG>
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
are executed, then the
<STRONG>while</STRONG>
command returns a zero exit status;
<STRONG>until</STRONG>
may be used in place of
<STRONG>while</STRONG>
to negate
the loop termination test.
<DT><STRONG>((</STRONG><EM>expression&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>))</STRONG><DD><BR>
<BR>
The
<EM>expression&nbsp;</EM>
is evaluated using the rules for arithmetic evaluation described below.
If the value of the arithmetic expression is non-zero, the exit
status is 0, otherwise the exit status is 1.
<DT><STRONG>(</STRONG><EM>list&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG><DD><BR>
<BR>
Execute
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
in a separate environment.
Note, that if two adjacent open parentheses are
needed for nesting, a space must be inserted to avoid
evaluation as an arithmetic command as described above.
<DT><STRONG>{ </STRONG><EM>list&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>;}</STRONG><DD><BR>
<BR>
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
is simply executed.
Note that unlike the metacharacters
<STRONG>(</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>)</STRONG>,
<STRONG>{</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>}</STRONG>
are
<EM>reserved word</EM>s
and must occur
at the beginning of a line or after a

<DT><STRONG>&#0091;&#0091;</STRONG><EM> expression &nbsp;</EM><STRONG>&#0093;&#0093;</STRONG><DD><BR>
<BR>
Evaluates
<EM>expression&nbsp;</EM>

<EM>expression&nbsp;</EM>
is true.
See
<EM>Conditional Expressions&nbsp;</EM>
below, for a description of
<EM>expression</EM>.
<DT><STRONG>function</STRONG> <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>{</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;}</STRONG><DD><BR>
<DT><EM>varname&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>() {</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;}</STRONG><DD><BR>
Define a function which is referenced by
<EM>varname</EM>.
A function whose
<EM>varname&nbsp;</EM>
contains a
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG>
is called a discipline function and the portion
of the
<EM>varname&nbsp;</EM>
preceding the last
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG>
must refer to an existing variable.
The body of the function is the
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
of commands between
<STRONG>{</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>}</STRONG>.
A function defined with the <STRONG>function</STRONG> <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM>
syntax can also be used as an argument to the <STRONG>.</STRONG>
special built-in command to get the equivalent behavior
as if the <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>()</STRONG> syntax were used to define it.
(See
<EM>Functions&nbsp;</EM>
below.)
<DT><STRONG>namespace</STRONG> <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>{</STRONG> <EM>list&nbsp;</EM> <STRONG>;}</STRONG><DD><BR>

<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
in this name space.
(See
<EM>Name Spaces&nbsp;</EM>
below.)

commands terminated by
<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>
to be placed in the background job pool
<EM>name</EM>.
If
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
is omitted a default unnamed pool is used.
Commands in a named background pool may be executed remotely.
<DT><STRONG>time</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>pipeline&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
<BR>
If <EM>pipeline&nbsp;</EM> is omitted the user and system time for
the current shell and completed child processes is printed
on standard error.
Otherwise,
<EM>pipeline&nbsp;</EM>
is executed and the elapsed time as well as
the user and system time are printed on standard error.
The
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>TIMEFORMAT</STRONG></FONT>
variable may be set to a format string that specifies how the timing
information should be displayed.
See
<STRONG>Shell Variables</STRONG>
below
for a description of the
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>TIMEFORMAT</STRONG></FONT>
variable.

<H5><A name="Variable Assignments">Variable Assignments</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
One or more variable assignments can start a simple command
or can be arguments to the
<STRONG>typeset</STRONG>,
<STRONG>enum</STRONG>,
<STRONG>export</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>readonly</STRONG>
special built-in commands as well as
to other declaration commands created as types.
The syntax for an <EM>assignment&nbsp;</EM> is of the form:
<DL>
<DT><EM>varname&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>=</STRONG><EM>word&nbsp;</EM><DD><BR>
<DT><EM>varname&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>&#0091;</STRONG><EM>word&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>&#0093;</STRONG>=<EM>word&nbsp;</EM><DD><BR>
No space is permitted between <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM> and the <STRONG>=</STRONG> or
between <STRONG>=</STRONG> and <EM>word&nbsp;</EM>.
<DT><EM>varname&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>=(</STRONG><EM>assign_list&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG><DD><BR>
No space is permitted between <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM> and the <STRONG>=</STRONG>.
The variable
<EM>varname</EM>
is unset before the assignment.
An <EM>assign_list&nbsp;</EM> can be one of the following:
<DIV class=FI>
<DL>
<DT><EM>word&nbsp;</EM> ...<DD><BR>
Indexed array assignment.
<DT><STRONG>&#0091;</STRONG><EM>word&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>&#0093;=</STRONG><EM>word&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<DD><BR>
Associative array assignment.
If preceded by
<STRONG>typeset &#45;a</STRONG>
this will create an indexed array instead.
<DT><EM>assignment&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<DD><BR>
Compound variable assignment.
This creates a compound variable <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM> with
sub-variables of the form <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>.</STRONG><EM>name&nbsp;</EM>,
where <EM>name&nbsp;</EM> is the name portion of <EM>assignment&nbsp;</EM>.
The value of <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM> will contain all the assignment elements.
Additional assignments made to sub-variables of <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM>
will also be displayed as part of the value of <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM>.
If no <EM>assignment</EM>s are specified, <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM> will be
a compound variable allowing subsequence child elements to be defined.
<DT><STRONG>typeset</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp;<EM>options</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; <EM>assignment&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<DD><BR>
Nested variable assignment.  Multiple assignments
can be specified by separating each of them with a <STRONG>;</STRONG>.
The previous value is unset before the assignment.
Other declaration commands such as
<STRONG>readonly,</STRONG>
<STRONG>enum</STRONG>,
and
other declaration commands can be used in place of
<STRONG>typeset</STRONG>.
<DT><STRONG>&nbsp;.</STRONG> <EM>filename&nbsp;</EM><DD><BR>
Include the assignment commands contained in
<EM>filename</EM>.
</DL>
</DIV>
<BR>
</DL><P>
In addition, a <STRONG>+=</STRONG> can be used in place of the <STRONG>=</STRONG>
to signify adding to or appending to the previous value.
When <STRONG>+=</STRONG> is applied to an arithmetic type, <EM>word&nbsp;</EM>
is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the current value.
When applied to a string variable, the value defined by <EM>word&nbsp;</EM>
is appended to the value.  For compound assignments, the previous
value is not unset and the new values are appended to the
current ones provided that the types are compatible.
<P>
The right hand side of a variable assignment undergoes all the expansion
listed below except word splitting, brace expansion, and file name generation.
When the left hand side is an assignment is a compound variable and
the right hand is the name of a compound variable, the compound variable
on the right will be copied or appended to the compound variable on the left.

<DIV class=FI>
The first word of each command is replaced by the text of an
<STRONG>alias</STRONG>
if an
<STRONG>alias</STRONG>
for this word has been defined.
An
<STRONG>alias</STRONG>
name consists of any number of characters excluding metacharacters,
quoting characters,
file expansion characters,
parameter expansion and command substitution
characters,
the characters
<STRONG>/</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>=</STRONG>.
The replacement string can contain any
valid shell script
including the metacharacters listed above.
The first word of each command in the
replaced text,
other than
any that are in the process of being replaced,
will be tested for aliases.
If the last character of the alias value is a
<EM>blank&nbsp;</EM>
then the word following the alias will also be checked for alias
substitution.
Aliases can be used to redefine
built-in commands but cannot be used to redefine
the reserved words listed above.
Aliases can be created and listed with the
<STRONG>alias</STRONG>
command and can be removed with the
<STRONG>unalias</STRONG>
command.
<P>
<EM>Aliasing&nbsp;</EM>
is performed when
scripts are read,
not while they are executed.
Therefore,
for an alias to take effect,
the

After alias substitution is performed, each word
is checked to see if it begins with an unquoted
<STRONG>~</STRONG>.
For tilde substitution,
<EM>word&nbsp;</EM>
also refers to the
<EM>word&nbsp;</EM>
portion of parameter expansion
(see
<EM>Parameter Expansion&nbsp;</EM>
below).
If it does, then the word up to a
<STRONG>/</STRONG>
is checked to see if it matches a user name in the
password database (See
<NOBR><A href="../man3/getpwname.html"><EM>getpwname</EM></A>(3).)</NOBR>
If a match is found, the
<STRONG>~</STRONG>
and the matched login name are replaced by the
login directory of the matched user.
If no match is found, the original text is left unchanged.
A
<STRONG>~</STRONG>
by itself, or in front of a
<STRONG>/</STRONG>,
is replaced by
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>$HOME</STRONG>.</FONT>
A
<STRONG>~</STRONG>
followed by a

or
<STRONG>&#45;</STRONG>
is replaced by the value of
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>$PWD</FONT></STRONG>
and
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>$OLDPWD</FONT></STRONG>
respectively.
A
<STRONG>~</STRONG>
followed by
<STRONG>{</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>}</STRONG>
where
<EM>fd&nbsp;</EM>
is a file descriptor number or the name of a variable
whose value is a file descriptor, is replaced by a string
that is the equivalent to the path name of the file or
directory corresponding to this file descriptor.
<P>
In addition,
when expanding a
<EM>variable assignment</EM>,
<EM>tilde</EM>
substitution is attempted when
the value of the assignment
begins with a
<STRONG>~</STRONG>,
and when a

A

one or more digits,

<STRONG>*</STRONG>,
<STRONG>@</STRONG>,
<STRONG>#</STRONG>,
<STRONG>?</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>$</STRONG>,
and
<STRONG>!\&nbsp;</STRONG>.
A
<EM>variable&nbsp;</EM>
is denoted by a <EM>vname</EM>.
To create a variable whose
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
contains a <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG>,
a variable whose
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
consists of everything before the last <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG> must already exist.
A
<EM>variable&nbsp;</EM>
has a
<EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
and zero or more
<EM>attributes</EM>.
<EM>Variables&nbsp;</EM>
can be assigned
<EM>values&nbsp;</EM>
and
<EM>attributes</EM>
by using the
<STRONG>typeset&nbsp;</STRONG>
special built-in command.
The attributes supported by the shell are described
later with the
<STRONG>typeset&nbsp;</STRONG>
special built-in command.
Exported variables pass values and attributes to
the environment.
<P>
The shell supports both indexed and associative arrays.
An element of an array variable is referenced by a
<EM>subscript</EM>.
A
<EM>subscript&nbsp;</EM>
for an indexed array is denoted by
an
<EM>arithmetic expression&nbsp;</EM>
(see
<EM>Arithmetic evaluation</EM>
below)
between a
<STRONG>&#0091;</STRONG>
and a
<STRONG>&#0093;</STRONG>.
To assign values to an indexed array, use
<EM>vname</EM><STRONG>=(</STRONG><EM>value</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<STRONG>)</STRONG> or
<STRONG>set &#45;A</STRONG> <EM>vname</EM>  <EM>value</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .
The value of all non-negative
subscripts must be in the
range of
0 through 4,194,303.
A negative subscript is treated as an offset from the maximum
current index +1 so that &#45;1 refers to the last element.
Indexed arrays can be declared with the
<STRONG>&#45;a</STRONG>
option to
<STRONG>typeset.</STRONG>
Indexed arrays need not be declared.
Any reference to a variable
with a valid subscript is
legal and an array will be created if necessary.
<P>
An associative array is created with the
<STRONG>&#45;A</STRONG>
option to
<STRONG>typeset.</STRONG>
A
<EM>subscript&nbsp;</EM>
for an associative array is denoted by
a string enclosed between
<STRONG>&#0091;</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>&#0093;</STRONG>.
<P>
Referencing any array without a subscript
is equivalent to referencing the array with subscript 0.
<P>
The
<EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
of a
<EM>variable&nbsp;</EM>
may be assigned by writing:
<P>
<DIV class=FI>
<EM>vname</EM><STRONG>=</STRONG><EM>value&nbsp;&nbsp;</EM>
&#0091;&nbsp;
<EM>vname</EM><STRONG>=</STRONG><EM>value&nbsp;</EM>

Attributes assigned by the
<EM>typeset&nbsp;</EM>
special built-in command apply to all elements of the array.
An array element can be a simple variable, a compound variable or an
array variable.  An element of an indexed array can be either an indexed
array or an associative array.  An element of an associative array can also
be either.  To refer to an array element that is part of an array
element, concatenate the subscript in brackets.  For example, to refer
to the
<EM>foobar&nbsp;</EM>
element of an associative array that is defined as the
third element of the indexed array, use
<STRONG>${</STRONG><EM>vname</EM><STRONG>&#0091;</STRONG><EM>3</EM><STRONG>&#0093;&#0091;</STRONG><EM>foobar</EM><STRONG>&#0093;}</STRONG>
<P>
<P>
A
<EM>nameref&nbsp;</EM>
is a variable that is a reference to another variable.
A nameref is created with the
<STRONG>&#45;n</STRONG>
attribute of
<STRONG>typeset</STRONG>.
The value of the variable at the time of the
<STRONG>typeset</STRONG>
command becomes the variable that will be referenced whenever
the nameref variable is used.
The name of a nameref cannot contain a <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG>.
When a variable or function name contains a <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG>, and the portion
of the name up to the first <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG> matches the
name of a nameref, the variable referred to is obtained by
replacing the nameref portion with the name of the variable
referenced by the nameref.
If a nameref is used as the index of a <STRONG>for</STRONG> loop,
a name reference is established for each item in the list.
A nameref provides a convenient way to refer to the variable
inside a function whose name is passed as an argument to a function.
For example, if the name of a variable is passed as the first
argument to a function, the command
<P>
<DIV class=FI>
<STRONG>typeset &#45;n var=$1</STRONG>
</DIV>
<BR>
<P>
inside the function causes references and assignments to
<STRONG>var</STRONG>
to be references and assignments to the variable whose
name has been passed to the function.
<P>
<P>
If any of the floating point attributes,
<STRONG>&#45;E</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;F</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>&#45;X</STRONG>,
or the integer attribute,
<STRONG>&#45;i</STRONG>,
is set for
<EM>vname</EM>,
then the
<EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
is subject to arithmetic evaluation as described below.
<P>

Positional parameters,
parameters denoted by a number,

special built-in command.
Parameter

The character
<STRONG>$</STRONG>

<EM>parameters</EM>.
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>${</STRONG><EM>parameter&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>}</STRONG><DD><BR>
The shell
reads all the characters from
<STRONG>${</STRONG>
to the matching
<STRONG>}</STRONG>
as part of the same word even if it contains
braces or metacharacters.
The value, if any, of the parameter is substituted.
The braces are required when
<EM>parameter&nbsp;</EM>
is followed by a letter, digit, or underscore
that is not to be interpreted as part of its name,
when the variable name contains a <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG>.
The braces are also required when a variable is subscripted
unless it is part of an Arithmetic Expression
or a Conditional Expression.
If
<EM>parameter&nbsp;</EM>
is one or more digits then it is a positional parameter.
A positional parameter of more than one digit must be
enclosed in braces.
If
<EM>parameter&nbsp;</EM>
is
<STRONG>*</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>@</STRONG>,
then all the positional
parameters, starting with
<STRONG>$1</STRONG>,
are substituted
(separated by a field separator character).
If an array
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
with last subscript
<STRONG>*</STRONG>
<STRONG>@</STRONG>,
or for index arrays of the form
<EM>sub1&nbsp;</EM>
<STRONG>..</STRONG>

<DT><STRONG>${#</STRONG><EM>vname</EM><STRONG>&#0091;@&#0093;}</STRONG><DD><BR>
The number of elements in the array

<DT><STRONG>${@</STRONG><EM>vname&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>}</STRONG><DD><BR>
Expands to the type name (See
<EM>Type Variables&nbsp;</EM>

<EM>vname</EM>.
<DT><STRONG>${$</STRONG><EM>parameter&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>}</STRONG><DD><BR>
If <STRONG>$</STRONG><EM>parameter</EM> expands to the name of a variable, this expands

It is undefined for special parameters.
<DT><STRONG>${!</STRONG><EM>vname&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>}</STRONG><DD><BR>
Expands to the name of the variable referred to by
<EM>vname</EM>.
This will be

is
<STRONG>*</STRONG>,

or of the form
<EM>sub1&nbsp;</EM>

<EM>sub2</EM>.
When
<EM>subscript&nbsp;</EM>
is
<STRONG>*</STRONG>,
the list of array subscripts for <EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
is generated.
For a variable that is not an array, the value is 0 if the variable
is set.  Otherwise it is null.
When
<EM>subscript&nbsp;</EM>
is
<STRONG>@</STRONG>,
same as above, except that when used in double quotes,
each array subscript yields a separate

When
<EM>subscript&nbsp;</EM>

<EM>sub2&nbsp;</EM>
it expands

<DT><STRONG>${</STRONG><EM>parameter&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>:?</STRONG><EM>word&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>}</STRONG><DD><BR>
If

The following
parameters
are automatically set by the shell:
<DIV class=FI>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>#</STRONG><DD>
The number of positional parameters in decimal.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;</STRONG><DD>
Options supplied to the shell on invocation or by
the

command.
<BR><DT><STRONG>?</STRONG><DD>
The decimal value returned by the last executed command.
<BR><DT><STRONG>$</STRONG><DD>
The process number of this shell.
<BR><DT><STRONG>_</STRONG><DD>
Initially, the value of
<STRONG>_</STRONG>
is an absolute pathname of the shell or script being executed
as passed in the
<EM>environment</EM>.
Subsequently it is assigned the last argument of the previous command.
This parameter is not set for commands which are asynchronous.
This parameter is also used to hold the name of the matching
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>MAIL</FONT></STRONG>
file when checking for mail.
While defining a compound variable or a type,
<STRONG>_</STRONG>
is initialized as a reference to the compound variable or type.
When a discipline function is invoked,
<STRONG>_</STRONG>
is initialized as a reference to the variable associated with
the call to this function.
Finally when
<STRONG>_</STRONG>
is used as the name of the first variable of a type definition,
the new type is derived from the type of the first variable (See
<EM>Type Variables&nbsp;</EM>
below.).
<BR><DT><STRONG>__</STRONG><DD>
When following a variable name and
<STRONG>.</STRONG>
this expands to the parent of variable when variable is a compound variable
or type instance.  If variable is a simple variable it expands to variable.
<BR><DT><STRONG>!</STRONG><DD>
The process id or the pool name and job number of the last background command
invoked or the most recent job put in the background with the
<STRONG>bg</STRONG>
built-in command.
Background jobs started in a named pool will be in the form
<EM>pool</EM><STRONG>.</STRONG><EM>number</EM>

If the value is changed as part of the trap action, then the new
value replaces the key (or key sequence) that caused the trap.
<DT><STRONG>.sh.edcol</STRONG><DD><BR>
The character position of the cursor at the time of the most recent
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>KEYBD</FONT></STRONG>
trap.

is null when processing a
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>KEYBD</FONT></STRONG>
trap.
<DT><STRONG>.sh.edtext</STRONG><DD><BR>
The characters in the input buffer at the time of the most recent
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>KEYBD</FONT></STRONG>
trap.

Set during a DEBUG trap to the line number for the caller of
each function.
<DT><STRONG>.sh.match</STRONG><DD><BR>
An indexed array which stores the most recent match and sub-pattern
matches after conditional pattern matches that match and after
variables expansions using the operators
<STRONG>#</STRONG>,
<STRONG>%</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>/</STRONG>.
The
<STRONG>0</STRONG>-th
element stores the complete match and the
<EM>i&nbsp;</EM>-th.
element stores the
<EM>i&nbsp;</EM>-th
submatch.
For
<STRONG>//</STRONG>
the array is two dimensional with the first subscript indicating the
most recent match and sub-pattern match and the second script indicating
which match with

are used by the shell:
<DIV class=FI>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>CDPATH</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
The search path for the
<STRONG>cd</STRONG>
command.
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>COLUMNS</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
If this variable is set,
the value is used to define the width of the edit window
for the shell edit modes and for printing
<STRONG>select</STRONG>
lists.
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>EDITOR</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
If the
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>VISUAL</FONT></STRONG>
variable is not set,
the value of this variable will be checked for the patterns
as described with
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>VISUAL</FONT></STRONG>
below and the corresponding editing option
(see Special Command
<STRONG>set</STRONG>
below)
will be turned on.
<DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>ENV</STRONG></FONT><DD>
If this variable is set, then
parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic substitution
are performed on
the value to generate
the pathname of the script that will be
executed when the shell
is invoked interactively
(see
<EM>Invocation&nbsp;</EM>
below).
This file is typically used for
<STRONG>alias</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>function</STRONG>
definitions.
The default value is
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-1>$HOME</FONT>/<STRONG>.</STRONG>kshrc</STRONG>.
On systems that support a system wide  <STRONG>/etc/ksh.kshrc</STRONG> initialization file,
if the filename generated by the expansion of
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>ENV</STRONG></FONT>
begins with
<STRONG>/./</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>.&nbsp;/.&nbsp;/</STRONG>
the system wide initialization file will not be executed.
<BR><DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>FCEDIT</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
Obsolete name for
the default editor name for the
<STRONG>hist</STRONG>
command.
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>FCEDIT</FONT></STRONG>
is not used when
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>HISTEDIT</FONT></STRONG>
is set.
<DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>FIGNORE</STRONG></FONT><DD><BR>
A pattern that defines the set of filenames that will be
ignored when performing filename matching.
<DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>FPATH</STRONG></FONT><DD><BR>
The search path for function definitions.
The directories in this path are searched for a file with the same name
as the function or command when a function with the
<STRONG>&#45;u</STRONG>
attribute is referenced and when a command is not found.
If an executable file with the name of that command is found,
then it is read and executed
in the current environment.
Unlike
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PATH</STRONG>,</FONT>
the current directory must be represented
explicitly by
<STRONG>.</STRONG>
rather than by adjacent
<STRONG>:</STRONG>
characters or a beginning or ending
<STRONG>:</STRONG>.
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>HISTCMD</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
Number of the current command in the history file.
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>HISTEDIT</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
Name for
the default editor name for the
<STRONG>hist</STRONG>
command.
<DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>HISTFILE</STRONG></FONT><DD><BR>
If this variable is set when the shell is invoked, then
the value is the pathname of the file that will be
used to store the command history (see
<EM>Command Re-entry&nbsp;</EM>
below).
<DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>HISTSIZE</STRONG></FONT><DD><BR>
If this variable is set when the shell is invoked, then
the number of previously entered commands that
are accessible by this shell
will be greater than or equal to this number.
The default is 512.
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>HOME</FONT></STRONG><DD>
The default argument (home directory) for the
<STRONG>cd</STRONG>
command.
<BR><DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>IFS</STRONG></FONT><DD>
Internal field separators,
normally
<STRONG>space</STRONG>,
<STRONG>tab</STRONG>,
and
<STRONG>new-line</STRONG>
that are used to separate the results of
command substitution or parameter expansion
and to separate fields with the built-in command
<STRONG>read</STRONG>.
The first character of the
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>IFS</STRONG></FONT>
variable is used to separate arguments for the
<STRONG>"$*"</STRONG>
substitution (see
<EM>Quoting</EM>
below).
Each single occurrence of
an
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>IFS</STRONG></FONT>
character in the string to be split,
that is not in the <EM>isspace&nbsp;</EM> character class, and any
adjacent characters in
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>IFS</STRONG></FONT>
that are in the <EM>isspace&nbsp;</EM> character class, delimit a field.
One or more
characters in
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>IFS</STRONG></FONT>
that belong to the <EM>isspace&nbsp;</EM> character class,
delimit a field.
In addition, if the same <EM>isspace&nbsp;</EM> character appears
consecutively inside
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>IFS</STRONG>,</FONT>
this character is treated as if it were not in the <EM>isspace&nbsp;</EM>
class, so that if
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>IFS</STRONG></FONT>
consists of two
<STRONG>tab</STRONG>
characters,
then two adjacent
<STRONG>tab</STRONG>
characters delimit a null field.
<BR><DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>JOBMAX</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
This variable defines the maximum number running background jobs
that can run at a time.  When this limit is reached, the
shell will wait for a job to complete before staring a new job.
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>LANG</FONT></STRONG><DD>
This variable determines the locale category for any
category not specifically selected with a variable
starting with
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>LC_</FONT></STRONG>
or
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>LANG</STRONG>.</FONT>
<BR><DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>LC_ALL</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
This variable overrides the value of the
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>LANG</FONT></STRONG>
variable and any other
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>LC_</FONT></STRONG>
variable.
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>LC_COLLATE</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
This variable determines the locale category for character
collation information.
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>LC_CTYPE</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
This variable determines the locale category for character
handling functions.
It determines the character classes for pattern matching (see
<EM>File Name Generation&nbsp;</EM>
below).
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>LC_NUMERIC</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
This variable determines the locale category for the
decimal point character.
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>LINES</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
If this variable is set,
the value is used to determine the column length for printing
<STRONG>select</STRONG>
lists.
Select lists will print vertically until about two-thirds of
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>LINES</FONT></STRONG>
lines are filled.
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>MAIL</FONT></STRONG><DD>
If this variable is set to the name of a mail file
<EM>and&nbsp;</EM>
the
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>MAILPATH</FONT></STRONG>
variable is not set,
then the shell informs the user of arrival of mail
in the specified file.
<BR><DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>MAILCHECK</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
This variable specifies how often (in seconds) the
shell will check for changes in the modification time
of any of the files specified by the
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>MAILPATH</FONT></STRONG>
or
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>MAIL</FONT></STRONG>
variables.
The default value is 600 seconds.
When the time has elapsed
the shell will check before issuing the next prompt.
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>MAILPATH</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
A colon (
<STRONG>:</STRONG>
)
separated list of file names.
If this variable is set,
then the shell informs the user of
any modifications to the specified files
that have occurred within the last
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>MAILCHECK</FONT></STRONG>
seconds.
Each file name can be followed by a
<STRONG>?</STRONG>
and a message that will be printed.
The message will undergo parameter expansion, command substitution,
and arithmetic substitution
with the variable
<STRONG>$_</STRONG>
defined as the name of the file that has changed.
The default message is
<EM>you have mail in $_&nbsp;.</EM>
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>PATH</FONT></STRONG><DD>
The search path for commands (see
<EM>Execution&nbsp;</EM>
below).
The user may not change
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-1>PATH</FONT></STRONG>
if executing under
<STRONG>rksh</STRONG>
(except in
<STRONG>.profile&nbsp;).</STRONG>
<BR><DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PS1</STRONG></FONT><DD>
The value of this variable is expanded for parameter
expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic substitution to define the
primary prompt string which by default is
``<STRONG>$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</STRONG>''.
The character
<STRONG>!</STRONG>
in the primary prompt string is replaced by the
<EM>command&nbsp;</EM>
number (see
<EM>Command Re-entry&nbsp;</EM>
below).
Two successive occurrences of
<STRONG>!</STRONG>
will produce a single
<STRONG>!</STRONG>
when the prompt string is printed.
<BR><DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PS2</STRONG></FONT><DD>
Secondary prompt string, by default
``<STRONG>&gt; &nbsp;</STRONG>''.
<BR><DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PS3</STRONG></FONT><DD>
Selection prompt string
used within a
<STRONG>select</STRONG>
loop, by default
``<STRONG>#? &nbsp;</STRONG>''.
<BR><DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PS4</STRONG></FONT><DD>
The value of this variable is expanded for parameter evaluation,
command substitution, and arithmetic substitution
and precedes each line of an execution trace.
By default,
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PS4</STRONG></FONT>
is
``<STRONG>+ &nbsp;</STRONG>''.
In addition
when
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PS4</STRONG></FONT>
is unset,
the execution trace prompt is also
``<STRONG>+ &nbsp;</STRONG>''.
<BR><DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>SH_OPTIONS</STRONG></FONT><DD><BR>
The value consists of blank separated
<EM>name</EM><STRONG>=</STRONG><EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
words.  For each
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
that is the name of a know option the variable
<STRONG>.sh.opt_</STRONG><EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
is assigned
<EM>value</EM>.
Currently the only valid option name is
<STRONG>astbin</STRONG>.
<DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>SHELL</STRONG></FONT><DD><BR>
The pathname of the
<EM>shell&nbsp;</EM>
is kept in the environment.
At invocation, if the basename of this variable is
<STRONG>rsh</STRONG>,
<STRONG>rksh</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>krsh</STRONG>,
then the shell becomes restricted.
If it is
<STRONG>pfsh</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>pfksh</STRONG>,
then the shell becomes a profile shell (see
<NOBR><A href="../man1/pfexec.html"><EM>pfexec</EM></A>(1)).</NOBR>
<DT><FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>TIMEFORMAT</STRONG></FONT><DD><BR>
The value of this parameter is used as a format string specifying
how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with the
<STRONG>time</STRONG>
reserved word should be displayed.
The <STRONG>%</STRONG> character introduces a format sequence that is
expanded to a time value or other information.
The format sequences and their meanings are as follows.
<P>
<DIV class=FI>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>%%</STRONG><DD>
A literal <STRONG>%</STRONG>.
<BR><DT><STRONG>%&#0091;<EM>p</EM>&#0093;&#0091;l&#0093;R</STRONG><DD><BR>

<DT><TT></TT><DD>
The brackets denote optional portions.
The optional <EM>p</EM> is a digit specifying the <EM>precision</EM>,
the number of fractional digits after a decimal point.
A value of 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to be output.
At most three places after the decimal point can be displayed;
values of <EM>p</EM> greater than 3 are treated as 3.
If <EM>p</EM> is not specified, the value 3 is used.
<DT><TT></TT><DD>
The optional <STRONG>l</STRONG> specifies a longer format, including
hours if greater than zero,
minutes, and seconds of the form <EM>HH</EM>h<EM>MM</EM>m<EM>SS</EM>.<EM>FF</EM>s.
The value of <EM>p</EM> determines whether or not the fraction is
included.
<DT><TT></TT><DD>
All other characters are output without change and a trailing
newline is added.
If unset, the default value, <STRONG>$'</STRONG>&#0092;nreal&#0092;t%2lR&#0092;nuser&#0092;t%2lU&#0092;nsys\t%2lS',
is used.  If the value is null, no timing information is displayed.
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>TMOUT</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
If set to a value greater than zero,
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>TMOUT</FONT></STRONG>
will be the default timeout value for the

built-in command.
The
<STRONG>select</STRONG>
compound command terminates after
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>TMOUT</FONT></STRONG>
seconds when input is from a terminal.
Otherwise,
the shell will terminate if a line is not entered within
the prescribed number of seconds while reading from a terminal.
(Note that the shell can be compiled with a maximum bound
for this value which cannot be exceeded.)
<DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>VISUAL</FONT></STRONG><DD><BR>
If the value of this variable matches the pattern

A pattern of the form
<STRONG>%(</STRONG><EM>pattern-pair&nbsp;</EM>(s)<STRONG>)</STRONG>
is a sub-pattern that
can be used to match nested character expressions.
Each
<EM>pattern-pair&nbsp;</EM>
is a two character sequence which cannot contain
<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>|</STRONG>.
The first
<EM>pattern-pair&nbsp;</EM>
specifies the starting and ending characters for the match.
Each subsequent
<EM>pattern-pair&nbsp;</EM>
represents the beginning and ending characters of a nested group that
will be skipped over when counting starting and ending character matches.
The behavior is unspecified when the first character of a
<EM>pattern-pair&nbsp;</EM>
is alpha-numeric
except for the following:
<DIV class=FI>
<DL>
<BR><DT><STRONG>D</STRONG><DD>
Causes the ending character to terminate the search for this pattern without
finding a match.
<BR><DT><STRONG>E</STRONG><DD>

<BR><DT><STRONG>L</STRONG><DD>
Causes the ending character to be interpreted as a quote character
causing all characters to be ignored when looking for a match.

<P>
Each sub-pattern in a composite pattern is numbered,
starting at 1, by the location of the <STRONG>(</STRONG> within

The sequence <STRONG></STRONG>&#0092;<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>, where <EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is a single digit and <STRONG></STRONG>&#0092;<EM>n&nbsp;</EM> comes after
the <EM>n</EM>-th. sub-pattern,
matches the same string as the sub-pattern itself.
<P>
Finally a pattern can contain sub-patterns of the form

where either <EM>options&nbsp;</EM> or <STRONG>:</STRONG><EM>pattern-list&nbsp;</EM>

these sub-patterns are not counted in the numbered sub-patterns.
<STRONG>:</STRONG><EM>pattern-list&nbsp;</EM> must be omitted for options
<STRONG>F</STRONG>,
<STRONG>G</STRONG>,

Enable the following options.  This is the default.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;</STRONG><DD>

The remainder of the pattern uses extended regular expression syntax
like the
<NOBR><A href="../man1/egrep.html"><EM>egrep</EM></A>(1)</NOBR>

<BR><DT><STRONG>F</STRONG><DD>
The remainder of the pattern uses
<NOBR><A href="../man1/fgrep.html"><EM>fgrep</EM></A>(1)</NOBR>

The remainder of the pattern uses basic regular expression syntax
like the

command.
<BR><DT><STRONG>K</STRONG><DD>
The remainder of the pattern uses shell pattern syntax.
This is the default.
<BR><DT><STRONG>N</STRONG><DD>
This is ignored.  However, when it is the first letter and is
used with file name generation, and no matches occur,
the file pattern expands to the empty string.
<BR><DT><STRONG>X</STRONG><DD>
The remainder of the pattern uses augmented regular expression syntax
like the
<NOBR><A href="../man1/xgrep.html"><EM>xgrep</EM></A>(1)</NOBR>

<H5><A name="Arithmetic Evaluation">Arithmetic Evaluation</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
The shell performs arithmetic evaluation for
arithmetic substitution, to evaluate an arithmetic command,
to evaluate an indexed array subscript,
and to evaluate arguments to
the built-in commands
<STRONG>shift&nbsp;</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>let</STRONG>.
Evaluations are performed using
double precision floating point
arithmetic or long double precision floating point for
systems that provide this data type.
Floating point constants follow the ANSI-C programming language
floating point conventions.
The floating point constants
<STRONG>Nan</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>Inf</STRONG>
can be use to represent "not a number" and infinity respectively.
Integer constants follow the ANSI-C programming language
integer constant conventions although only single byte
character constants are recognized and character casts
are not recognized.
In addition constants can be of the form
&#0091;&nbsp;<EM>base</EM><STRONG>#&nbsp;</STRONG>&nbsp;&#0093;<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
where
<EM>base&nbsp;</EM>
is a decimal number between two and sixty-four
representing the arithmetic base
and
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is a number in that base.
The digits above 9 are represented
by the lower case letters, the upper case letters,
<STRONG>@</STRONG>,
and
<STRONG>_</STRONG>
respectively.
For bases less than or equal to 36, upper and lower case
characters can be used interchangeably.
<P>
An arithmetic expression uses the same syntax, precedence, and
associativity of
expression as the C language.
All the C language operators
that apply to floating point quantities can be used.
In addition, the operator
<STRONG>**</STRONG>
can be used for exponentiation.
It has higher precedence than multiplication and is left associative.
In addition, when the value of an arithmetic variable
or sub-expression can be represented as a long integer,
all C language integer arithmetic operations can be performed.
Variables can be referenced by name within an arithmetic expression
without using the parameter expansion syntax.
When a variable is referenced, its value is evaluated as
an arithmetic expression.
<P>
Any of the following math library functions that are in the C math library
can be used within an arithmetic expression:

<EM>ident&nbsp;</EM>
is a name reference to this array.  Otherwise, 
<EM>ident&nbsp;</EM>
is a reference to long double precision floating point variable containing
the value from the caller.
The value of
<STRONG>.sh.value</STRONG>
when the function returns is the value of this function.
User defined functions can take up to 3 arguments and override C math library
functions.

special built-in command.
The

option causes the expansion of the value to be represented using
scientific notation when it is expanded.
The optional option argument
<EM>n</EM>
defines the number of significant figures.
The

option causes the expansion to be represented as a floating decimal number
when it is expanded.
The
<STRONG>&#45;X</STRONG>
option cause the expansion to be represented using the
<STRONG>%a</STRONG>
format defined by ISO C-99.
The optional option argument
<EM>n</EM>
defines the number of places after the decimal (or radix) point in this case.

The optional option argument
<EM>n</EM>
specifies an arithmetic base to be used when expanding the variable.
If you do not specify an arithmetic base,
base 10 will be used.

When used interactively,
the shell prompts with the value of
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PS1</STRONG></FONT>
after expanding it for parameter expansion, command substitution, and
arithmetic substitution,
before reading a command.
In addition, each single
<STRONG>!</STRONG>
in the prompt is replaced by the command number.
A
<STRONG>!!</STRONG>
is required to place
<STRONG>!</STRONG>
in the prompt.
If at any time a new-line is typed and further input is needed
to complete a command, then the secondary prompt
(i.e., the value of
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-1>PS2</FONT></STRONG>)
is issued.

</DL><P>
If one of the above is preceded by a digit,
with no intervening space, then the
file descriptor number referred to is that specified
by the digit
(instead of the default 0 or 1).
If one of the above, other than

<STRONG>&lt;#</STRONG>
forms,
is preceded by
<STRONG>{</STRONG><EM>varname</EM><STRONG>}</STRONG>

then a file descriptor number &gt; 10

the shell and stored in the variable
<EM>varname</EM>.
If

or the any of the
<STRONG>&gt;#</STRONG>

<STRONG>&lt;#</STRONG>
forms
is preceded by
<STRONG>{</STRONG><EM>varname</EM><STRONG>}</STRONG>
the value of
<EM>varname&nbsp;</EM>
defines the file descriptor to close or position.
For example:
<P>
<DIV class=FI>
<STRONG><!--NULL-->.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;2&gt;&amp;1</STRONG>
</DIV>
<BR>
<P>
means file descriptor 2 is to be opened
for writing as a duplicate

<P>
<DIV class=FI>
<STRONG>exec {n}&lt;file</STRONG>

<BR>
<P>
means open file named
<STRONG>file</STRONG>
for reading and store
the file descriptor number in variable
<STRONG>n</STRONG>.
<P>
The order in which redirections are specified is significant.
The shell evaluates each redirection in terms of the
(<EM>file descriptor</EM>, <EM>file</EM>)
association at the time of evaluation.
For example:
<P>
<DIV class=FI>
<STRONG><!--NULL-->.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;1&gt;</STRONG><EM>fname&nbsp;</EM> 2&gt;&amp;1
</DIV>
<BR>
<P>
first associates file descriptor 1 with file
<EM>fname&nbsp;</EM>.
It then associates file descriptor 2 with the file associated with file
descriptor 1 (i.e.
<EM>fname&nbsp;</EM>).
If the order of redirections were reversed, file descriptor 2 would be associated
with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been) and then file descriptor
1 would be associated with file
<EM>fname&nbsp;</EM>.
<P>
If a command is followed by
<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>

then the default standard input
for the command
is the empty file
<STRONG>/dev/null</STRONG>.
Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command contains the
file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by
input/output specifications.
<P>

<DIV class=FI>
The
<EM>environment&nbsp;</EM>
(see
<NOBR><A href="../man7/environ.html"><EM>environ</EM></A>(7))</NOBR>
is a list of name-value pairs that is passed to
an executed program in the same way as a normal argument list.
The names must be
<EM>identifiers&nbsp;</EM>
and the values are character strings.
The shell interacts with the environment in several ways.
On invocation, the shell scans the environment
and creates a
variable
for each name found,
giving it the corresponding value and attributes and marking it
<EM>export</EM>.
Executed commands inherit the environment.
If the user modifies the values of these
variables
or creates new ones,
using the
<STRONG>export</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>typeset &#45;x</STRONG>
commands, they become part of the
environment.
The environment seen by any executed command is thus composed
of any name-value pairs originally inherited by the shell,
whose values may be modified by the current shell,
plus any additions
which must be noted in
<STRONG>export</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>typeset &#45;x</STRONG>
commands.
<P>
The environment for any
<EM>simple-command&nbsp;</EM>
or function
may be augmented by prefixing it with one or more variable assignments.
A variable assignment argument is a word of the form
<EM>identifier=value</EM>.
Thus:
<P>
<DIV class=FI>
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-1>TERM</FONT>=450 &nbsp;cmd &nbsp;args</STRONG>				and
<BR>
<STRONG>(export &nbsp;<FONT SIZE=-1>TERM<FONT SIZE=+1>; &nbsp;</FONT>TERM</FONT>=450; &nbsp;cmd &nbsp;args)</STRONG>
</DIV>
<BR>
<P>
are equivalent (as far as the above execution of
<EM>cmd&nbsp;</EM>
is concerned except for special built-in commands listed below &#45;
those that are
preceded with a dagger).
<P>
If the obsolete
<STRONG>&#45;k</STRONG>
option is set,
<EM>all&nbsp;</EM>
variable assignment arguments are placed in the environment,
even if they occur after the command name.
The following
first prints
<STRONG>a=b c</STRONG>
and then
<STRONG>c</STRONG>:
<P>
<DIV class=FI>

<B>echo &nbsp;a=b &nbsp;c

<H5><A name="Functions">Functions</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
<P>
For historical reasons, there are two
ways to define functions,
the
<EM>name</EM><STRONG>(&nbsp;)</STRONG>
syntax and
the
<STRONG>function</STRONG>
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
syntax, described in the
<EM>Commands</EM>
section above.
Shell functions are read in and stored internally.
Alias names are resolved when the function is read.
Functions are executed like commands with the arguments
passed as positional parameters.
(See
<EM>Execution</EM>
below.)
<P>
Functions defined by the
<STRONG>function</STRONG>
<EM>name</EM>
syntax and called by name execute in the same process as the caller and
share all files
and present working directory with the
caller.
Traps caught by the caller are reset to their default action
inside the function.
A trap condition that is not caught or ignored by the
function causes the function to terminate and the condition
to be passed on to the caller.
A trap on
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>EXIT</STRONG></FONT>
set inside a function
is executed
in the environment
of the caller
after the function completes.
Ordinarily,
variables are shared between the calling program
and the function.
However,
the
<STRONG>typeset</STRONG>
special built-in command used within a function
defines local variables whose scope includes
the current function.
They can be passed to functions that they call in the
variable assignment list that precedes the call or as arguments
passed as name references.
Errors within functions return control to the caller.
<P>
Functions defined with the
<EM>name</EM><STRONG>(&nbsp;)</STRONG>
syntax and functions defined with the
<STRONG>function</STRONG>
<EM>name</EM>
syntax that are invoked with the <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG>
special built-in
are executed in the caller's
environment and share all variables
and traps with the caller.
Errors within these function executions cause the script that contains
them to abort.
<P>
The special built-in command
<STRONG>return</STRONG>
is used to return
from function calls.
<P>
Function names
can be listed with the
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>+f</STRONG>
option of the
<STRONG>typeset</STRONG>
special built-in command.
The text of functions, when available, will also
be listed with
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>.
Functions can be undefined with the
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>
option of the
<STRONG>unset</STRONG>
special built-in command.
<P>
Ordinarily, functions are unset when the shell executes a shell script.
Functions that need to be defined across separate
invocations of the shell should
be placed in a directory and the
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>FPATH</FONT></STRONG>
variable should contain the name of this directory.
They may also
be specified in the
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>ENV</FONT></STRONG>

<H5><A name="Discipline Functions">Discipline Functions</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
Each variable can have zero or more discipline functions
associated with it.
The shell initially understands the discipline names <STRONG>get</STRONG>,
<STRONG>set</STRONG>, <STRONG>append</STRONG>, and <STRONG>unset</STRONG> but can be added
when defining new types.  On most systems
others can be added at run time via the
C programming interface extension provided by the
<STRONG>builtin</STRONG>
built-in utility.
If the <STRONG>get</STRONG> discipline is defined for a variable, it is invoked
whenever the given variable is referenced.
If the variable <STRONG>.sh.value</STRONG> is assigned a value inside
the discipline function, the referenced variable will evaluate
to this value instead.
If the <STRONG>set</STRONG> discipline is defined for a variable, it is invoked
whenever the given variable is assigned a value.
If the <STRONG>append</STRONG> discipline is defined for a variable, it is invoked
whenever a value is appended to the given variable.
The variable <STRONG>.sh.value</STRONG> is given the value
of the variable before invoking the discipline, and
the variable will be assigned the value of <STRONG>.sh.value</STRONG>
after the discipline completes.
If <STRONG>.sh.value</STRONG> is unset inside the discipline, then
that value is unchanged.
If the <STRONG>unset</STRONG> discipline is defined for a variable, it is invoked
whenever the given variable is unset.
The variable will not be unset unless it is unset explicitly
from within this discipline function.
<P>
The variable
<STRONG>.sh.name</STRONG>
contains the name of the variable for which the discipline function is called,
<STRONG>.sh.subscript</STRONG>
is the subscript of the variable, and
<STRONG>.sh.value</STRONG>
will contain the value being assigned inside the
<STRONG>set</STRONG>
discipline function.
The variable
<STRONG>_</STRONG>
is a reference to the variable including the subscript if any.
For the <STRONG>set</STRONG> discipline,
changing
<STRONG>.sh.value</STRONG>
will change the value that gets assigned.
Finally, the expansion <STRONG>${</STRONG><EM>var&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>.</STRONG><EM>name&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>}</STRONG>,
when <EM>name&nbsp;</EM> is the name of a discipline, and there is
no variable of this name, is equivalent to the command substitution
<STRONG>${ </STRONG><EM>var&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>.</STRONG><EM>name&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>;}</STRONG>.

<DIV class=FI>
Commands and functions that are executed as part of the
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
of a
<STRONG>namespace</STRONG>
command that modify variables or create new ones, create
a new variable whose
name is the name of the name space
as given by
<EM>identifier&nbsp;</EM>
preceded by <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG>.
When a variable whose name is
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
is referenced, it is
first searched for
using <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG><EM>identifier</EM><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG><EM>name</EM>.
Similarly, a function defined by a command in the
<STRONG>namespace</STRONG>
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
is created using the name space name  preceded by a <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG>.
<P>
When  the
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
of a
<STRONG>namespace</STRONG>
command contains a
<STRONG>namespace</STRONG>
command, the names of variables and functions that are created consist
of the variable or function name preceded by the list of
<EM>identifier&nbsp;</EM>s
each preceded by <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT></STRONG>.
<P>
Outside of a name space, a variable or function created inside a
name space can be referenced by preceding it with the name space name.

By default, variables staring with
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>.</FONT>sh</STRONG> are in the

</DIV>
<H5><A name="Type Variables">Type Variables</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
Typed variables provide a way to create data structure and objects.
A type can be defined either by a shared library, by the
<STRONG>enum</STRONG>
built-in command described below, or by using the new
<STRONG>&#45;T</STRONG>
option of the
<STRONG>typeset</STRONG>
built-in command.
With the
<STRONG>&#45;T</STRONG>
option of
<STRONG>typeset</STRONG>,
the type name, specified as an option argument to
<STRONG>&#45;T</STRONG>,
is set with a compound variable assignment that defines the type.
Function definitions can appear inside the compound variable
assignment and these become discipline functions for this type and
can be invoked or redefined by each instance of the type.
The function name
<STRONG>create</STRONG>
is treated specially.  It is invoked for each instance of
the type that is created but is not inherited and cannot be
redefined for each instance.
<P>
When a type is defined a special built-in command of that name
is added.  These built-ins are declaration commands and follow the
same expansion rules as all the special built-in commands defined
below that are preceded by &#167;&#167;.  These commands can subsequently
be used inside further type definitions.  The man page for these commands can
be generated by using the
<STRONG>&#45;&#45;man</STRONG>
option or any of the other
<STRONG>&#45;&#45;</STRONG>
options described with
<STRONG>getopts</STRONG>.
The
<STRONG>&#45;r</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;a</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;A</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;h</STRONG>,
and
<STRONG>&#45;S</STRONG>
options of
<STRONG>typeset</STRONG>
are permitted with each of these new built-ins.
<P>
An instance of a type is created by invoking the type name
followed by one or more instance names.
Each instance of the type is initialized with a copy of the sub-variables
except for sub-variables that are defined with the
<STRONG>&#45;S</STRONG>
option.  Variables defined with the
<STRONG>&#45;S</STRONG>
are shared by all instances of the type.
Each instance can change the value of any sub-variable and can also
define new discipline functions of the same names
as those defined by the type definition as well as any
standard discipline names.
No additional sub-variables can be defined for any instance.
<P>
When defining a type,
if the value of a sub-variable is not set and the
<STRONG>&#45;r</STRONG>
attribute is specified, it causes the sub-variable
to be a required sub-variable.
Whenever an instance of a type is created, all required sub-variables
must be specified.
These sub-variables become readonly in each instance.
<P>
When
<STRONG>unset</STRONG>
is invoked on a sub-variable within a type,
and the
<STRONG>&#45;r</STRONG>
attribute has not been specified for this field,
the value is reset to the default value associative with
the type.
Invoking
<STRONG>unset</STRONG>
on a type instance not contained within another type deletes
all sub-variables and the variable itself.
<P>
A type definition can be derived from another type definition
by defining the first sub-variable name as
<STRONG>_</STRONG>
and defining its type as the base type.
Any remaining definitions will be additions and modifications
that apply to the new type.
If the new type name is the same is that of the base type,
the type will be replaced and the original type will
no longer be accessible.
<P>
The
<STRONG>typeset</STRONG>
command with the
<STRONG>&#45;T</STRONG>
and no option argument or operands will write all the type definitions to
standard output in a form that that can be read in to create all they types.
<P>
</DIV>
<H5><A name="Jobs">Jobs</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
<P>
If the
<STRONG>monitor</STRONG>
option of the
<STRONG>set</STRONG>
command is turned on,
an interactive shell associates a <EM>job</EM> with each pipeline.
It keeps
a table of current jobs, printed by the
<STRONG>jobs</STRONG>
command, and assigns them small integer numbers.
When a job is started asynchronously with
<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>,
the shell prints a line which looks
like:
<P>
<TT><PRE>     	&#0091;1&#0093; 1234
</PRE></TT>
<P>
indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number
1 and had one (top-level) process, whose process id was 1234.
<P>
This paragraph and the next require features that are
not in all versions of UNIX and may not apply.
If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the key
<STRONG>^Z</STRONG> (control-Z) which sends a STOP signal to the current job.
The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been `Stopped',
and print another prompt.
You can then manipulate the state of this job,
putting it in the background with the
<STRONG>bg</STRONG>
command, or run some other
commands and then eventually bring the job back into the foreground with
the foreground command
<STRONG>fg</STRONG>.
A <STRONG>^Z</STRONG> takes effect immediately and
is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread input are discarded
when it is typed.
<P>
A job being run in the background will stop if it tries to read
from the terminal.
Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output,
but this can be disabled by giving the command
<STRONG>stty tostop</STRONG>.
If you set this
tty option, then background jobs will stop when they try to produce
output like they do when they try to read input.
<P>
A job pool is a collection of jobs started with
<EM>list&nbsp;</EM>
<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>
associated with a name.
<P>
There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.
A job can be referred to by the process id of any process of the job
or by one of the following:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>%</STRONG><EM>number</EM><DD><BR>
The job with the given number.
<DT><EM>pool&nbsp;</EM><DD><BR>
All the jobs in the job pool named by
<EM>pool</EM>.
<DT><EM>pool</EM><STRONG>.</STRONG><EM>number</EM><DD><BR>
The job number
<EM>number&nbsp;</EM>
in the job pool named by
<EM>pool</EM>.
<DT><STRONG>%</STRONG><EM>string</EM><DD><BR>
Any job whose command line begins with
<EM>string</EM>.
<DT><STRONG>%?</STRONG><EM>string</EM><DD><BR>
Any job whose command line contains
<EM>string</EM>.
<DT><STRONG>%%</STRONG><DD>
Current job.
<BR><DT><STRONG>%+</STRONG><DD>
Equivalent to
<STRONG>%%</STRONG>.
<BR><DT><STRONG>%&#45;</STRONG><DD>
Previous job.
In addition, unless noted otherwise, wherever a job can be specified,
the name of a background job pool can be used to represent all the
jobs in that pool.
</DL><P>
The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state.
It normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that
no further progress is possible, but only just before it prints
a prompt.
This is done so that it does not otherwise disturb your work.
The
<STRONG>notify</STRONG>
option of the
<STRONG>set</STRONG>
command causes
the shell to print these job change messages
as soon as they occur.
<P>
When the
<STRONG>monitor</STRONG>
option is on, each background job that completes
triggers any trap set for
<STRONG>CHLD</STRONG>.
<P>
When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running or stopped, you will
be warned that `You have stopped(running) jobs.'
You may use the
<STRONG>jobs</STRONG>
command to see what they are.
If you immediately try to
exit again, the shell will not warn you a second time, and the stopped
jobs will be terminated.
When a login shell receives a HUP signal, it sends
a HUP signal to each job that has not been disowned with the
<STRONG>disown</STRONG>
built-in command described below.
<P>
</DIV>
<H5><A name="Signals">Signals</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
The <FONT SIZE=-1>INT<FONT SIZE=+1> and </FONT>QUIT</FONT> signals for an invoked
command are ignored if the command is followed by
<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>
and the
<STRONG>monitor</STRONG>
option is not active.
Otherwise, signals have the values
inherited by the shell from its parent
(but see also
the
<STRONG>trap</STRONG>
built-in command below).
<P>
</DIV>
<H5><A name="Execution">Execution</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
Each time a command is read, the above substitutions
are carried out.
If the command name matches one
of the
<EM>Special Built-in Commands&nbsp;</EM>
listed below,
it is executed within the
current shell process.
Next, the command name is checked to see if
it matches a user defined function.
If it does,
the positional parameters are saved
and then reset to the arguments of the
<EM>function&nbsp;</EM>
call.
A function is also executed in the
current shell process.
When the
<EM>function&nbsp;</EM>
completes or issues a
<STRONG>return</STRONG>,
the positional parameter list is restored.
For functions defined with the
<STRONG>function</STRONG>
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
syntax,
any trap set on
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>EXIT</STRONG></FONT>
within the function is executed.
The exit value of a
<EM>function&nbsp;</EM>
is the value of the last command executed.
If a command name is not a
<EM>special built-in command&nbsp;</EM>
or a user defined
<EM>function</EM>,
but it is one of the built-in commands listed below,
it is executed in the current shell process.
<P>
The shell variables
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>PATH</FONT></STRONG>
followed by the variable
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>FPATH</FONT></STRONG>
defines the list of directories to
search for the command name.
Alternative directory names are separated by
a colon
(<STRONG>:</STRONG>).
The default path is
<STRONG>/bin:/usr/bin:</STRONG>
(specifying
<STRONG>/bin</STRONG>,
<STRONG>/usr/bin</STRONG>,
and the current directory
in that order).
The current directory can be specified by
two or more adjacent colons, or by a colon
at the beginning or end of the path list.
If the command name contains a <STRONG>/</STRONG>, then the search path
is not used.
Otherwise, each directory in the list of directories defined by
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>PATH</FONT></STRONG>
and
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>FPATH</FONT></STRONG>
is checked in order.
If the directory being searched is contained in
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>FPATH</FONT></STRONG>
and contains a file whose name matches the command being searched,
then this file is loaded into the current shell environment
as if it were the argument to the <STRONG>.</STRONG> command
except that only preset aliases are expanded,
and a function of the given name is executed
as described above.
<P>
If this directory is not in
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>FPATH</FONT></STRONG>
the shell first
determines whether there is a built-in version
of a command corresponding to a given pathname and if so
it is invoked in the current process.
If no built-in is found, the shell checks for a file named
<STRONG>.paths</STRONG>
in this directory.
If found and there is a line of the form
<STRONG>FPATH=</STRONG><EM>path</EM>
where
<EM>path&nbsp;</EM>
names an
existing directory
then that directory is searched after immediately after the current directory
as if it were found in the
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>FPATH</FONT></STRONG>
variable.
If
<EM>path&nbsp;</EM>
does not begin with /, it is checked for relative to the directory
being searched.
<P>
The
<STRONG>.paths</STRONG>
file is then checked  for a line of the form
<STRONG>PLUGIN_LIB=</STRONG><EM>libname</EM>
&#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>:</STRONG> <EM>libname&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .
Each library named by
<EM>libname&nbsp;</EM>
will be searched for as if it were an option argument to
<STRONG>builtin -f</STRONG>,
and if it contains a built-in of the specified name
this will be executed instead of a command by this name.
Any built-in loaded from a library found this way will be associated
with the directory containing the
<STRONG>.paths</STRONG>
file so it will only execute if not found in an earlier directory.
<P>
Finally, the directory will be checked for a file of the given name.
If the file has execute permission but is not an
<STRONG>a.out</STRONG>
file,
it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands.
A separate shell is spawned to read it.
All non-exported variables are removed in this case.
If the shell command
file doesn't have read permission,
or if the
<EM>setuid</EM>
and/or
<EM>setgid</EM>
bits are set on the file,
then the shell executes an agent whose job it is to
set up the permissions and execute the shell with the
shell command file passed down as an open file.
If the
<STRONG>.paths</STRONG>
contains a line of the form
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>=</STRONG><EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
in the first or second line, then the environment variable
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
is modified by prepending the directory specified by
<EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
to the directory list.
If
<EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
is not an absolute directory, then it
specifies a directory relative to the directory that the
executable was found.
If the environment variable
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
does not already exist it will be added to the environment
list for the specified command.
A parenthesized command is executed in
a sub-shell without removing non-exported variables.

The text of the last
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>HISTSIZE</FONT></STRONG>
(default 512)
commands entered from a terminal device
is saved in a
<EM>history</EM>
file.
The file
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-1>$HOME</FONT>/.sh_history</STRONG>
is used if the
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>HISTFILE</FONT></STRONG>
variable is not set
or if the file it names is not writable.
A shell can access the commands of
all
<EM>interactive</EM>
shells which use the same named
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>HISTFILE</STRONG>.</FONT>
The built-in command
<STRONG>hist&nbsp;</STRONG>
is used to list or
edit a portion of this file.
The portion of the file to be edited or listed can be selected by
number or by giving the first character or
characters of the command.
A single command or range of commands can be specified.
If you do not specify an editor program as
an argument to
<STRONG>hist&nbsp;</STRONG>
then the value of the variable
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>HISTEDIT</STRONG></FONT>
is used.
If
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>HISTEDIT</STRONG></FONT>
is unset, the obsolete variable
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>FCEDIT</STRONG></FONT>
is used.
If
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>FCEDIT</STRONG></FONT>
is not defined, then
<STRONG>/bin/ed</STRONG>
is used.
The edited command(s) is printed and re-executed upon
leaving the editor unless you quit without writing.
The
<STRONG>&#45;s</STRONG>
option
(and in obsolete versions, the editor name
<STRONG>&#45;&nbsp;</STRONG>)
is used to skip the editing phase and
to re-execute the command.
In this case a substitution parameter of the form
<EM>old</EM><STRONG>=</STRONG><EM>new</EM>
can be used to modify the command before execution.
For example, with the preset alias
<STRONG>r</STRONG>,
which is aliased to
<STRONG>'hist &#45;s'</STRONG>,
typing
`<STRONG>r bad=good c</STRONG>'
will re-execute the most recent command which starts with the letter
<STRONG>c</STRONG>,
replacing the first occurrence of the string
<STRONG>bad</STRONG>
with the string
<STRONG>good</STRONG>.

Normally, each command line entered from a terminal device is simply

If either the
<STRONG>emacs</STRONG>,
<STRONG>gmacs</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>vi</STRONG>
option is active, the user can edit the command line.
To be in either of these edit modes
<STRONG>set</STRONG>
the corresponding
option.
An editing option is automatically selected each time the
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>VISUAL</STRONG></FONT>
or
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>EDITOR</STRONG></FONT>
variable is assigned a value ending in either of these
option names.
<P>
The editing features require that the user's terminal
accept `RETURN' as carriage return without line feed
and that a space (`&nbsp;') must overwrite the current character on
the screen.
<P>
Unless the
<STRONG>multiline</STRONG>
option is on,
the editing modes implement a concept where the user is looking through a
window at the current line.
The window width is the value of
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG></FONT>
if it is defined, otherwise 80.
If the window width is too small to display the prompt and leave
at least 8 columns to enter input, the prompt is truncated from the
left.
If the line is longer than the window width minus two, a mark is
displayed at the end of the window to notify the user.
As the cursor moves and reaches the window boundaries the window will be
centered about the cursor.
The mark is a
<STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> (&lt;<STRONG>,</STRONG>
<STRONG>*</STRONG>)
if the line extends on the
right (left, both) side(s) of the window.
<P>
The search commands in each edit mode provide access to the history file.
Only strings are matched, not patterns, although a leading
<STRONG>^</STRONG>
in the string restricts the match
to begin at the first character in the line.
<P>
Each of the edit modes has an operation to list the files
or commands that match a partially entered word.
When applied to the first word on the line,
or the first word after a
<STRONG>;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>|</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>(</STRONG>,
and the word does not begin with
<STRONG>~</STRONG>
or contain a
<STRONG>/</STRONG>,
the list of aliases, functions, and executable commands
defined by the
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>PATH</FONT></STRONG>
variable that could match the partial word is displayed.
Otherwise, the list of files that match the given
word is displayed.
If the partially entered word does not contain any
file expansion characters, a
<STRONG>*</STRONG>
is appended before generating these lists.
After displaying the generated list, the input line
is redrawn.
These operations are called command name listing and file name listing,
respectively.
There are additional operations, referred to as command name
completion and file name completion, which compute the list
of matching commands or files, but instead of printing the list,
replace
the current word with a complete or partial match.
For file name completion,
if the match is unique, a
<STRONG>/</STRONG>
is appended if the file is a directory and a space is
appended if the file is not a directory.
Otherwise, the longest common prefix for all the matching
files replaces the word.
For command name completion, only the portion of the file names
after the last
<STRONG>/</STRONG>
are used to find the longest command prefix.
If only a single name matches this prefix, then the
word is replaced with the command name followed by a space.
When using a
<EM>tab&nbsp;</EM>
for completion that does not yield a unique match,
a subsequent
<EM>tab&nbsp;</EM>
will provide a numbered list of matching alternatives.
A specific selection can be made by entering the
selection number followed by a
<EM>tab</EM>.

The
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>KEYBD</FONT></STRONG>
trap can be used to intercept keys as they are typed
and change the characters that are actually seen by
the shell.
This trap is executed after each character
(or sequence of characters when the first character is ESC)
is entered while reading from a terminal.
The variable
<STRONG>.sh.edchar</STRONG>
contains the character or character sequence which
generated the trap.
Changing the value of
<STRONG>.sh.edchar</STRONG>
in the trap action causes the shell to behave as if the
new value were entered from the keyboard rather than
the original value.
<P>
The variable
<STRONG>.sh.edcol</STRONG>
is set to the input column number of the cursor at the time
of the input.
The variable
<STRONG>.sh.edmode</STRONG>
is set to
ESC
when in
<STRONG>vi</STRONG>
insert mode (see below) and is null otherwise.
By prepending
<STRONG>${.sh.editmode}</STRONG>
to a value assigned to
<STRONG>.sh.edchar</STRONG>
it will cause the shell

<DIV class=FI>
This mode is entered by enabling either the
<STRONG>emacs</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>gmacs</STRONG>
option.
The only difference between these two modes is the way
they handle
<STRONG>^T</STRONG>.
To edit, the user
moves the cursor to the point needing correction and
then inserts or deletes characters or words as needed.
All the editing commands are control characters or escape
sequences.
The notation for control characters is caret
(<STRONG>^</STRONG>)
followed
by the character.
For example,
<STRONG>^F</STRONG>
is the notation for control
<STRONG>F</STRONG>.
This is entered by depressing `f' while holding down the
`CTRL' (control) key.
The `SHIFT' key is
<EM>not</EM>
depressed.
(The notation
<STRONG>^?</STRONG>
indicates the DEL (delete) key.)
<P>
The notation for escape sequences is
<STRONG>M-</STRONG>
followed by a
character.
For example,
<STRONG>M-f</STRONG>
(pronounced Meta f)
is entered by depressing ESC
(ascii
<STRONG>033</STRONG>)
followed by `f'.
(<STRONG>M-F</STRONG>
would be the notation for ESC followed by `SHIFT' (capital) `F'.)

<DIV class=FI>
There are two typing modes.
Initially, when you enter a command you are in the
<EM>input&nbsp;</EM>
mode.
To edit, the user enters
<EM>control&nbsp;</EM>
mode by typing ESC
(<STRONG>033</STRONG>)
and moves the cursor to the point needing correction and
then inserts or deletes characters or words as needed.
Most control commands accept an optional repeat
<EM>count</EM>
prior to the command.
<P>
When in
<STRONG>vi</STRONG>
mode on most systems,
canonical processing is initially enabled and the
command will be echoed again if the speed is 1200 baud or greater and it
contains any control characters or less than one second has elapsed
since the prompt was printed.
The ESC character terminates canonical processing for the remainder of the command
and the user can then modify the command line.
This scheme has the advantages of canonical processing with the type-ahead
echoing of raw mode.
<P>
If the option
<STRONG>viraw</STRONG>
is also set, the terminal will always have canonical processing
disabled.
This mode is implicit for systems that do not support two
alternate end of line delimiters,
and may be helpful for certain terminals.

<BR><DT>&#0091;<EM>count</EM>&#0093;<STRONG>=</STRONG><DD><BR>
If <EM>count</EM> is not specified,
it generates the list of matching commands or

Otherwise, the word under the the cursor is replaced by the
<EM>count</EM> item from the most recently generated command or file list.
If the cursor is not on a word, it is inserted instead.
<DT><STRONG>@</STRONG><EM>letter</EM><DD><BR>
Your alias list is searched for an

By default, hitting the
<STRONG>tab</STRONG>
key causes the current word to be matched against files starting with
the characters you typed and adding as many characters that provide a
unique match.  If the matching prefix is not unique hitting
<STRONG>tab</STRONG>
again will output a numbered list with the choices and entering
<EM>number&nbsp;</EM>
<STRONG>tab</STRONG>
will replace the current word with that selection.
<P>
Programmable completion allows you to control how words are expanded when
you enter the
<STRONG>tab</STRONG>
key for one or more specified commands.
The
<STRONG>complete</STRONG>
built-in command allows you to specify how to complete the current word of the
specified command.

The following simple-commands are executed in the shell process.
Input/Output redirection is permitted.
Unless otherwise indicated, the output is written on file descriptor 1
and the exit status, when there is no syntax error, is zero.
Except for
<STRONG>:</STRONG>,
<STRONG>true</STRONG>,
<STRONG>false</STRONG>,
<STRONG>echo</STRONG>,
<STRONG>newgrp</STRONG>,
and
<STRONG>login</STRONG>,
all built-in commands accept
<STRONG>&#45;&#45;</STRONG>
to indicate end of options.
They also interpret the option
<STRONG>&#45;&#45;man</STRONG>
as a request to display the man page onto
standard error and
<STRONG>&#45;?</STRONG>
as a help request which prints a
<EM>usage&nbsp;</EM>
message
on standard error.
Commands that are preceded by one or two &#167; symbols
are special built-in commands and
are treated specially in the following ways:
<DL>
<BR><DT>1.<DD>
Variable assignment lists preceding the command
remain in effect when the command completes.
<BR><DT>2.<DD>
I/O redirections are processed after variable assignments.
<BR><DT>3.<DD>
Errors
cause a script
that contains them to abort.
<BR><DT>4.<DD>
They are not valid function names.
<BR><DT>5.<DD>
Words
following a command preceded by &#167;&#167;
that are in the format of a variable assignment
are expanded with the same rules as a variable assignment.
This means that
tilde substitution is performed after the
<STRONG>=</STRONG>
sign and field splitting and file name generation are not
performed.
These are called
<EM>declaration&nbsp;</EM>
built-ins.
<DT>&#167; <STRONG>:</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>arg&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
The command only expands parameters.
<BR>
<DT>&#167; <STRONG>&nbsp;. </STRONG><EM>name&nbsp;</EM> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>arg&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
If
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
is a function defined with the
<STRONG>function</STRONG>
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
reserved word syntax,
the function is executed in the current environment
(as if it had been defined with the
<EM>name</EM><STRONG>()</STRONG>
syntax.)
Otherwise if
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
refers to a file, the
file is read in its entirety and the commands are
executed in the current shell environment.
The search path
specified by
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>PATH</FONT></STRONG>
is used to find the directory containing the file.
If any arguments
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
are given,
they become the positional parameters while processing
the
<STRONG>.</STRONG>
command and the original positional parameters are restored upon completion.
Otherwise the positional parameters are unchanged.
The exit status is the exit status of the last command executed.
<DT>&#167;&#167; <STRONG>alias</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;ptx</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093;  &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>name</EM>&#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>=</STRONG><EM>value&nbsp;</EM>  &nbsp;&#0093; &nbsp;&#0093; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<DD><BR>
<STRONG>alias&nbsp;</STRONG>
with no arguments prints the list of aliases
in the form
<EM>name=value&nbsp;</EM>
on standard output.
The
<STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG>
option
causes the word
<STRONG>alias</STRONG>
to be inserted before each one.
When one or more arguments are given,
an
<EM>alias&nbsp;</EM>
is defined
for each
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
whose
<EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
is given.
A trailing space in
<EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
causes the next word to be checked for
alias substitution.
The obsolete
<STRONG>&#45;t</STRONG>
option is used to set and list tracked aliases.
The value of a tracked alias is the full pathname
corresponding to the given
<EM>name</EM>.
The value becomes undefined when the value of
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PATH</STRONG></FONT>
is reset but the alias remains tracked.
Without the
<STRONG>&#45;t</STRONG>
option,
for each
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
in the argument list
for which no
<EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
is given, the name
and value of the alias is printed.
The obsolete
<STRONG>&#45;x</STRONG>
option has no effect.
The exit status is non-zero if a
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
is given, but no value, and no alias has been defined for the
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>.
<DT><STRONG>bg</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>job&nbsp;</EM>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
This command is only on systems that support job control.
Puts each specified
<EM>job&nbsp;</EM>
into the background.
The current job is put in the background
if
<EM>job&nbsp;</EM>
is not specified.
See
<EM>Jobs</EM>
for a description of the format of
<EM>job</EM>.
<DT>&#167; <STRONG>break</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>n&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
Exit from the enclosing
<STRONG>for&nbsp;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>while&nbsp;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>until&nbsp;</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>select&nbsp;</STRONG>
loop, if any.
If
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is specified, then break
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
levels.
<DT><STRONG>builtin</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;dsp</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG> <EM>file&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>name&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
If
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
is not specified,
and no
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>
option is specified,
the built-ins are printed on standard output.
The
<STRONG>&#45;s</STRONG>
option prints only the special built-ins.
Otherwise, each
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
represents the pathname whose basename is the name of the built-in.
The entry point function name is determined by prepending
<STRONG>b_</STRONG>
to the built-in name.
A built-in specified by a pathname will only be executed when that pathname
would be found during the path search.  Built-ins found in libraries loaded
via the
<STRONG>.paths</STRONG>
file will be associate with the pathname of the directory containing the
<STRONG>.paths</STRONG>
file.
<P>
The ISO C/C++ prototype is
<STRONG>b_</STRONG><EM>mycommand</EM><STRONG>(int</STRONG> <EM>argc</EM>, <STRONG>char *</STRONG><EM>argv</EM><STRONG>&#0091;&#0093;</STRONG>, <STRONG>void *</STRONG><EM>context</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
for the builtin command
<EM>mycommand&nbsp;</EM>
where
<EM>argv&nbsp;</EM>
is array an of
<EM>argc&nbsp;</EM>
elements and context is an optional pointer to a
<STRONG>Shell_t</STRONG>
structure as described in
<STRONG>&lt;ast/shell.h&gt;</STRONG>.
<P>
Special built-ins cannot be bound to a pathname or deleted.
The
<STRONG>&#45;d</STRONG>
option deletes each of the given built-ins.
On systems that support dynamic loading, the
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>
option names a shared library containing the code for built-ins.
The shared library prefix and/or suffix, which depend on the system,
can be omitted.
Once a library is loaded, its symbols become available
for subsequent invocations of
<STRONG>builtin</STRONG>.
Multiple libraries can be specified with separate invocations
of the
<STRONG>builtin</STRONG>
command.
Libraries are searched in the reverse order in which they are specified.
When a library is loaded, it looks for a function in the library
whose name is
<STRONG>lib_init()</STRONG>
and invokes this function with an argument of
<STRONG>0</STRONG>.
<P>
The
<STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG>
causes the output to be in a form of
<STRONG>builtin</STRONG>
commands that can be used as input to the shell to recreate the current
set of builtins.
<DT><STRONG>cd</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;LP</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>arg&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
<DT><STRONG>cd</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;LP</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; <EM>old&nbsp;</EM> <EM>new&nbsp;</EM><DD><BR>
This command can be in either of two forms.
In the first form it
changes the current directory to
<EM>arg</EM>.
If
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
is
<STRONG>&#45;</STRONG>
the directory is changed to the previous
directory.
The shell
variable
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>HOME</FONT></STRONG>
is the default
<EM>arg</EM>.
The variable
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PWD</STRONG></FONT>
is set to the current directory.
The shell variable
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>CDPATH</FONT></STRONG>
defines the search path for
the directory containing
<EM>arg</EM>.
Alternative directory names are separated by
a colon
(<STRONG>:</STRONG>).
The default path is
<STRONG>&lt;null&gt;</STRONG>
(specifying the current directory).
Note that the current directory is specified by a null path name,
which can appear immediately after the equal sign
or between the colon delimiters anywhere else in the path list.
If
<EM>arg</EM>
begins with a <STRONG>/</STRONG> then the search path
is not used.
Otherwise, each directory in the path is
searched for
<EM>arg</EM>.
<P>
The second form of
<STRONG>cd</STRONG>
substitutes the string
<EM>new</EM>
for the string
<EM>old</EM>
in the current directory name,
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PWD</STRONG>,</FONT>
and tries to change to this new directory.
<P>
By default, symbolic link names are treated literally when
finding the directory name.
This is equivalent to the
<STRONG>&#45;L</STRONG>
option.
The
<STRONG>&#45;P</STRONG>
option causes
symbolic links to be resolved when determining the directory.
The last instance of
<STRONG>&#45;L</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>&#45;P</STRONG>
on the command line
determines which method is used.
<P>
The
<STRONG>cd&nbsp;</STRONG>
command may not be executed by
<STRONG>rksh&nbsp;.</STRONG>
<STRONG>rksh93&nbsp;.</STRONG>
<DT><STRONG>command</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;pvxV</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; <EM>name&nbsp;</EM> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>arg&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
Without the
<STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>&#45;V</STRONG>
options,
<STRONG>command</STRONG>
executes
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
with the arguments given by
<EM>arg</EM>.
The
<STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG>
option causes
a default path to be searched
rather than the one defined by the value of
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PATH</STRONG>.</FONT>
Functions will not be searched for when finding
<EM>name</EM>.
In addition, if
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
refers to a special built-in,
none of the special properties associated with the leading
daggers will be honored.
(For example, the predefined alias
<STRONG>redirect='command exec'</STRONG>
prevents a script from terminating when an invalid
redirection is given.)
With the
<STRONG>&#45;x</STRONG>
option,
if command execution would result in a failure because
there are too many arguments, errno
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>E2BIG</STRONG>,</FONT>
the shell will invoke command
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
multiple times with a subset of the arguments on each invocation.
Arguments that occur prior to the first word that
expands to multiple arguments and after the last word
that expands to multiple arguments will be passed on each invocation.
The exit status will be the maximum invocation exit status.
With the
<STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG>
option,
<STRONG>command</STRONG>
is equivalent to the built-in
<STRONG>whence</STRONG>
command described below.
The
<STRONG>&#45;V</STRONG>
option causes
<STRONG>command</STRONG>
to act like
<STRONG>whence &#45;v</STRONG>.
<DT>&#167; <STRONG>continue</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>n&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
Resume the next iteration of the enclosing
<STRONG>for&nbsp;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>while&nbsp;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>until&nbsp;</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>select&nbsp;</STRONG>
loop.
If
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is specified, then resume at the
<EM>n</EM>-th
enclosing loop.
<DT><STRONG>disown</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>job&nbsp;</EM>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
Causes the shell not to send a HUP signal to
each given
<EM>job</EM>,
or all active jobs if
<EM>job</EM>
is omitted,
when a login shell terminates.
<DT><STRONG>echo</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>arg&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
When the first
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
does not begin with a &#45;, and
none of the arguments contain a &#0092;,
then
<STRONG>echo</STRONG>
prints each of its arguments separated by a space
and terminated by a new-line.
Otherwise, the behavior of
<STRONG>echo</STRONG>
is system dependent
and
<STRONG>print</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>printf</STRONG>
described below should be used.
See
<NOBR><A href="../man1/echo.html"><EM>echo</EM></A>(1)</NOBR>
for usage and description.
<DT>&#167;&#167; <STRONG>enum</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;i</STRONG>  &nbsp;&#0093; <EM>type&nbsp;</EM>&#0091;&nbsp;=(<EM>value&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.) &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
Creates a declaration command named <EM>type&nbsp;</EM> that is an
integer type that allows one of the specified <EM>value</EM>s as
enumeration names.  If <STRONG>=(</STRONG><EM>value&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG> is
omitted, then <EM>type&nbsp;</EM> must be an indexed array variable with at
least two elements and the values are taken from this array variable.
If
<STRONG>-i</STRONG>
is specified the values are case insensitive.
<P>
When an enumeration variable is used in arithmetic expression, its value
is the index into the array that defined it starting from index 0.
Enumeration strings can be used in an arithmetic expression when comparing
against an enumeration variable.
Also, each non-subscripted enumeration variable followed by
<STRONG>.name</STRONG>
where name is one of the enumeration names expands to the index
corresponding to
<STRONG>name</STRONG>.
<P>
The enum
<STRONG>_Bool</STRONG>
is created with values
<STRONG>true</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>false</STRONG>.
The predefined alias
<STRONG>bool</STRONG>
is defined as
<STRONG>_Bool</STRONG>.
<DT>&#167; <STRONG>eval</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>arg&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
The arguments are read as input
to the shell
and the resulting command(s) executed.
<DT>&#167; <STRONG>exec</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;c</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;a</STRONG> <EM>name&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>arg&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
If
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
is given,
the command specified by
the arguments is executed in place of this shell
without creating a new process.
The
<STRONG>&#45;c</STRONG>
option causes the environment to be cleared before applying
variable assignments associated with the
<STRONG>exec</STRONG>
invocation.
The
<STRONG>&#45;a</STRONG>
option
causes
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
rather than the first
<EM>arg</EM>,
to become
<STRONG>argv&#0091;0&#0093;</STRONG>
for the new process.
Input/output arguments may appear and
affect the current process.
If
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
is not given,
the effect of this command is to
modify file descriptors
as prescribed by the input/output redirection list.
In this case,
any file descriptor numbers greater than 2 that are
opened with this mechanism are closed when invoking
another program.
<DT>&#167; <STRONG>exit</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>n&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
Causes the shell to exit
with the exit status specified by
<EM>n</EM>.
The value will be the least significant 8 bits of the specified status.
If
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is omitted, then the exit status is that of the last command executed.
An end-of-file will also cause the shell to exit
except for a
shell which has the
<STRONG>ignoreeof</STRONG>
option (see
<STRONG>set</STRONG>
below) turned on.
<DT>&#167;&#167; <STRONG>export</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>name&nbsp;</EM>&#0091;&nbsp;<STRONG>=</STRONG><EM>value&nbsp;</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; &nbsp;&#0093; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<DD><BR>
If
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
is not given,
the names and values of each variable with
the export attribute are printed with the values
quoted in a manner that allows them to be re-input.
The
<STRONG>export</STRONG>
command is the same as
<STRONG>typeset &#45;x</STRONG>
except that if you use
<STRONG>export</STRONG>
within a function, no local
variable is created.
The
<STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG>
option
causes the word
<STRONG>export</STRONG>
to be inserted before each one.
Otherwise, the given
<EM>name</EM>s
are marked for automatic
export to the
<EM>environment&nbsp;</EM>
of subsequently-executed commands.
<DT><STRONG>false</STRONG><DD><BR>
Does nothing, and exits 1. Used with
<STRONG>until</STRONG>
for infinite loops.
<DT><STRONG>fg</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>job&nbsp;</EM>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
This command is only on systems that support job control.
Each
<EM>job&nbsp;</EM>
specified is brought to the foreground and waited for in
the specified order.
Otherwise, the current job is
brought into the foreground.
See
<EM>Jobs</EM>
for a description of the format of
<EM>job</EM>.
<DT><STRONG>getconf</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>name&nbsp;</EM> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>pathname&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093; &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
Prints the current value of the configuration parameter given by
<EM>name</EM>.
The configuration parameters are defined by the IEEE POSIX 1003.1
and IEEE POSIX 1003.2 standards.
(See
<NOBR><A href="../man2/pathconf.html"><EM>pathconf</EM></A>(2)</NOBR>
and
<NOBR><A href="../man2/sysconf.html"><EM>sysconf</EM></A>(2).)</NOBR>
The
<EM>pathname</EM>
argument is required for parameters whose value depends on
the location in the file system.
If no arguments are given,
<STRONG>getconf</STRONG>
prints the names and values of the current configuration
parameters.
The pathname
<STRONG>/</STRONG>
is used for each of the parameters that requires
<EM>pathname</EM>.
<DT><STRONG>getopts</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&nbsp;&#45;a</STRONG> <EM>name&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093; <EM>optstring vname&nbsp;</EM> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>arg&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
Checks
<EM>arg</EM>
for legal options.
If
<EM>arg</EM>
is omitted,
the positional parameters are used.
An option argument begins with a
<STRONG>+</STRONG>
or a
<STRONG>&#45;</STRONG>.
An option not beginning with
<STRONG>+</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>&#45;</STRONG>
or the argument
<STRONG>&#45;&nbsp;&#45;</STRONG>
ends the options.
Options beginning with
<STRONG>+</STRONG>
are only recognized when
<EM>optstring&nbsp;</EM>
begins with a
<STRONG>+</STRONG>.
<EM>optstring&nbsp;</EM>
contains the letters that
<STRONG>getopts</STRONG>
recognizes.
If a letter is followed by a
<STRONG>:</STRONG>,
that option is expected to have an argument.
The options can be separated from the argument by blanks.
The option
<STRONG>&#45;?</STRONG>
causes
<STRONG>getopts</STRONG>
to generate a usage message on standard error.
The
<STRONG>&#45;a</STRONG>
argument can be used to specify the name to use for the
usage message, which defaults to
<STRONG>$0</STRONG>.
<P>
<STRONG>getopts</STRONG>
places the next option letter it finds inside variable
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
each time it is invoked.
The option letter will be prepended with a
<STRONG>+</STRONG>
when
<EM>arg</EM>
begins with a
<STRONG>+</STRONG>.
The index of the next
<EM>arg</EM>
is stored in
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>OPTIND</STRONG>.</FONT>
The option argument,
if any,
gets stored in
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>OPTARG</STRONG>.</FONT>
<P>
A leading
<STRONG>:</STRONG>
in
<EM>optstring</EM>
causes
<STRONG>getopts</STRONG>
to store the letter of an invalid
option in
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>OPTARG</STRONG>,</FONT>
and to set
<EM>vname</EM>
to
<STRONG>?</STRONG>
for an unknown option and to
<STRONG>:</STRONG>
when a required option argument is missing.
Otherwise,
<STRONG>getopts</STRONG>
prints an error message.
The exit status is non-zero when there are no more options.
<P>
There is no way to specify any of the options
<STRONG>:</STRONG>,
<STRONG>+</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>?</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#0091;</STRONG>,
and
<STRONG>&#0093;</STRONG>.
The option
<STRONG>#</STRONG>
can only be specified as the first option.
<DT><STRONG>hist</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;e</STRONG> <EM>ename&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;nlr&nbsp;</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>first&nbsp;</EM> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>last&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093; &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>

In the first form,
a range of commands from
<EM>first&nbsp;</EM>
to
<EM>last&nbsp;</EM>
is selected from the last
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>HISTSIZE</STRONG></FONT>
commands that were typed at the terminal.
The arguments
<EM>first&nbsp;</EM>
and
<EM>last&nbsp;</EM>
may be specified as a number or as a string.
A string is used to locate the most recent command starting with
the given string.
A negative number is used as an offset to the current command number.
If the
<STRONG>&#45;l</STRONG>
option
is selected,
the commands are listed on standard output.
Otherwise, the editor program
<EM>ename&nbsp;</EM>
is invoked on a file containing these
keyboard commands.
If
<EM>ename&nbsp;</EM>
is not supplied, then the value of the variable
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>HISTEDIT</STRONG></FONT>
is used.
If
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>HISTEDIT</STRONG></FONT>
is not set, then
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>FCEDIT</STRONG></FONT>
(default
<STRONG>/bin/ed&nbsp;</STRONG>)
is used as the editor.
When editing is complete, the edited command(s)
is executed if the changes have been saved.
If
<EM>last&nbsp;</EM>
is not specified,
then it will be set to
<EM>first</EM>.
If
<EM>first&nbsp;</EM>
is not specified,
the default is the previous command
for editing and &#45;16 for listing.
The option
<STRONG>&#45;r</STRONG>
reverses the order of the commands and
the option
<STRONG>&#45;n</STRONG>
suppresses command numbers when listing.
In the second form,
<EM>command&nbsp;</EM>
is interpreted as
<EM>first&nbsp;</EM>
described above
and defaults to the last command executed.

Sends either the TERM (terminate) signal or the
specified signal to the specified jobs or processes.
Signals are either given by number with the
<STRONG>&#45;n</STRONG>
option or by name with the
<STRONG>&#45;s</STRONG>
option
(as given in
<STRONG>&lt;signal.h&gt;</STRONG>,
stripped of the prefix ``SIG'' with
the exception that SIGCLD is named CHLD).
For backward compatibility, the
<STRONG>n</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>s</STRONG>
can be omitted and the number or name placed immediately
after the
<STRONG>&#45;</STRONG>.
If the signal being sent is TERM (terminate) or HUP (hangup),
then the job or process will be sent a CONT (continue) signal
if it is stopped.
The argument
<EM>job&nbsp;</EM>
can be the process id of a process that is not a member of one of the
active jobs.
See
<EM>Jobs</EM>
for a description of the format of
<EM>job</EM>.
In the third form,
<STRONG>kill &#45;l</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>kill &#45;L</STRONG>,
if
<EM>sig&nbsp;</EM>
is not specified,
the signal names are listed.
The
<STRONG>&#45;l</STRONG>
option list only the signal names.
<STRONG>&#45;L</STRONG>
options lists each signal name and corresponding number.
Otherwise, for each
<EM>sig&nbsp;</EM>
that is a name, the corresponding signal number is listed.
For each
<EM>sig&nbsp;</EM>
that is a number, the signal name corresponding to the
least significant 8 bits of
<EM>sig&nbsp;</EM>
is listed.
<P>
On systems that support
<NOBR><A href="../man2/sigqueue.html"><EM>sigqueue</EM></A>(2)</NOBR>
the
<STRONG>&#45;Q</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>&#45;q</STRONG>
option can be used to send a queued signal with message number
<EM>n</EM>.
With
<STRONG>&#45;Q</STRONG>
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is sent in the pointer portion of the signal value and it can hold an unsigned
long integer.  With
<STRONG>&#45;q</STRONG>
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is sent in the integer portion of the signal value, it can hold a signed
integer.  Each specified
<EM>job</EM>
must be a positive number.
On systems that do not support
<NOBR><A href="../man2/sigqueue.html"><EM>sigqueue</EM></A>(2),</NOBR>
a signal is sent without the message number
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
and will not be queued.
If the signal cannot be queued because of a return of EAGAIN, the exit status
will be 2.
<DT><STRONG>let</STRONG> <EM>arg&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<DD><BR>
Each

With no options or with option
<STRONG>&#45;</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>&#45;&nbsp;&#45;</STRONG>,
each
<EM>arg</EM>
is printed
on standard output.
The
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>
option causes the arguments to be printed as
described by
<STRONG>printf</STRONG>.
In this case, any
<STRONG>e</STRONG>,
<STRONG>n</STRONG>,
<STRONG>r</STRONG>,
<STRONG>R</STRONG>
options are ignored.
Otherwise,
unless the
<STRONG>&#45;C</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;R</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;r</STRONG>,
or
<STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG>
are specified, the following
escape conventions will be applied:
<DIV class=FI>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>&#0092;a</STRONG><DD>
The alert character (ascii
<STRONG>07</STRONG>).
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#0092;b</STRONG><DD>
The backspace character (ascii
<STRONG>010</STRONG>).
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#0092;c</STRONG><DD>
Causes
<STRONG>print</STRONG>
to end without processing more arguments and
not adding a new-line.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#0092;f</STRONG><DD>
The formfeed character (ascii
<STRONG>014</STRONG>).
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#0092;n</STRONG><DD>
The new-line character (ascii
<STRONG>012</STRONG>).
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#0092;r</STRONG><DD>
The carriage return character (ascii
<STRONG>015</STRONG>).
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#0092;t</STRONG><DD>
The tab character (ascii
<STRONG>011</STRONG>).
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#0092;v</STRONG><DD>
The vertical tab character (ascii
<STRONG>013</STRONG>).
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#0092;E</STRONG><DD>
The escape character (ascii
<STRONG>033</STRONG>).
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#0092;&#0092;</STRONG><DD>
The backslash character &#0092;.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#0092;0</STRONG><EM>x</EM><DD>
The character defined by the 1, 2, or 3-digit octal
string given by <EM>x</EM>.
</DL><P>
The
<STRONG>&#45;R</STRONG>
option will print all subsequent arguments and options
other than
<STRONG>&#45;n</STRONG>.
The
<STRONG>&#45;e</STRONG>
causes the above escape conventions to be applied.
This is the default behavior.
It reverses the effect of an earlier
<STRONG>&#45;r</STRONG>.
The
<STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG>
option causes the
arguments to be written onto the pipe
of the process spawned with
<STRONG>|&amp;</STRONG>
instead of standard output.
The
<STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG>
option treats each
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
as a variable name and writes the value in
the
<STRONG>printf</STRONG>
<STRONG>%B</STRONG>
format.
The
<STRONG>&#45;C</STRONG>
option treats each
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
as a variable name and writes the value in
the
<STRONG>printf</STRONG>
<STRONG>%#B</STRONG>
format.
The
<STRONG>&#45;s</STRONG>
option causes the
arguments to be written onto the history file
instead of standard output.
The
<STRONG>&#45;u</STRONG>
option can be used to specify a one digit
file descriptor unit number
<EM>unit&nbsp;</EM>
on which the
output will be placed.
The default is 1.
If the option
<STRONG>&#45;n</STRONG>
is used, no
<STRONG>new-line&nbsp;</STRONG>
is added to the output.
</DIV>
<BR>
<DT><STRONG>printf</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG> <EM>varname&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093; <EM>format&nbsp;</EM> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>arg&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
The arguments
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
are printed on standard output
in accordance with the ANSI-C
formatting rules associated with the format string
<EM>format</EM>.
If the number of arguments exceeds the number of
format specifications, the
<STRONG>format&nbsp;</STRONG>
string is reused to format remaining arguments.
If the <STRONG>-v</STRONG> option is specified the output is assigned to the variable
<EM>varname</EM>.
The following extensions can also be used:
<DIV class=FI>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>%b</STRONG><DD>
A
<STRONG>%b</STRONG>
format can be used instead of
<STRONG>%s</STRONG>
to cause escape sequences in the corresponding
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
to be expanded as described in
<STRONG>print.</STRONG>
<BR><DT><STRONG>%B</STRONG><DD>
A
<STRONG>%B</STRONG>
option causes each of the arguments to be treated
as variable names and the binary value of variable
will be printed.
The alternate flag
<STRONG>#</STRONG>
causes a compound variable to be output on a single line.
This is most useful for compound variables and variables whose attribute
is
<STRONG>&#45;b</STRONG>.
<BR><DT><STRONG>%H</STRONG><DD>
A
<STRONG>%H</STRONG>
format can be used instead of
<STRONG>%s</STRONG>
to cause characters in
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
that are special in HTML and XML
to be output as their entity name.
The alternate flag
<STRONG>#</STRONG>
formats the output for use as a URI.
<BR><DT><STRONG>%P</STRONG><DD>
A
<STRONG>%P</STRONG>
format can be used instead of
<STRONG>%s</STRONG>
to cause
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
to be interpreted as an extended regular
expression and be printed as a shell pattern.
<BR><DT><STRONG>%R</STRONG><DD>
A
<STRONG>%R</STRONG>
format can be used instead of
<STRONG>%s</STRONG>
to cause
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
to be interpreted as a shell pattern
and to be printed as an extended regular expression.
<BR><DT><STRONG>%q</STRONG><DD>
A
<STRONG>%q</STRONG>
format can be used instead of
<STRONG>%s</STRONG>
to cause the resulting string to be quoted in a manner than can
be reinput to the shell.
When
<STRONG>q</STRONG>
is preceded by the alternative format specifier,
<STRONG>#</STRONG>,
the string is quoted in manner suitable as a field in a
<STRONG>.csv</STRONG>
format file.
<BR><DT><STRONG>%(</STRONG><EM>date-format</EM><STRONG>)T</STRONG><DD><BR>
A
<STRONG>%(</STRONG><EM>date-format</EM><STRONG>)T</STRONG>
format can be use to treat an argument as a date/time string
and to format the date/time according to the
<EM>date-format&nbsp;</EM>
as defined for the
<NOBR><A href="../man1/date.html"><STRONG>date</STRONG></A>(1)</NOBR>
command.
Values specified as digits are interpreted as described in the
<NOBR><A href="../man1/touch.html"><STRONG>touch</STRONG></A>(1)</NOBR>
command.
<DT><STRONG>%Z</STRONG><DD>
A
<STRONG>%Z</STRONG>
format will output a byte whose value is 0.
<BR><DT><STRONG>%d</STRONG><DD>
The precision field of the
<STRONG>%d</STRONG>
format can be followed by a
<STRONG>.</STRONG>
and the output base.
In this case, the
<STRONG>#</STRONG>
flag character causes
<EM>base</EM><STRONG>#</STRONG>
to be prepended.
<BR><DT><STRONG>#</STRONG><DD>
The
<STRONG>#</STRONG>
flag, when used with the
<STRONG>%d</STRONG>
format without an output base,
displays the output in powers of 1000 indicated by one of the following suffixes:
<STRONG>k M G T P E</STRONG>,
and when used with the
<STRONG>%i</STRONG>
format displays the output in powers of 1024 indicated by one of the following suffixes:
<STRONG>Ki Mi Gi Ti Pi Ei</STRONG>.
<BR><DT><STRONG>=</STRONG><DD>
The
<STRONG>=</STRONG>
flag centers the output within the specified field width.
<BR><DT><STRONG>L</STRONG><DD>
The
<STRONG>L</STRONG>
flag, when used with the
<STRONG>%c</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>%s</STRONG>
formats, treats precision as character width instead of byte count.
<BR><DT><STRONG>,</STRONG><DD>
The
<STRONG>,</STRONG>
flag, when used with the
<STRONG>%d</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>%f</STRONG>
formats, separates groups of digits with the grouping delimiter
(<STRONG>,</STRONG>
on groups of 3 in the C locale.)
</DL><P>

Outputs the value of the current working
directory.
The
<STRONG>&#45;L</STRONG>
option is the default; it prints the logical name of the current directory.
If the
<STRONG>&#45;P</STRONG>
option is given,
all symbolic links are resolved from the name.
The last instance of
<STRONG>&#45;L</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>&#45;P</STRONG>
on the command line
determines which method is used.
If the
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>
option is specified, the directory name corresponding to file descriptor
<EM>fd</EM>
is outputted.
<DT><STRONG>read</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;ACSprsv&nbsp;</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;d</STRONG> <EM>delim&nbsp;</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;n</STRONG> <EM>n&nbsp;</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;N</STRONG> <EM>n&nbsp;</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;m</STRONG> <EM>method&nbsp;</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;t</STRONG> <EM>timeout&nbsp;</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;u</STRONG> <EM>unit&nbsp;</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>vname</EM><STRONG>?</STRONG><EM>prompt&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>vname&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
The shell input mechanism.
One line is read and
is broken up into fields using the characters in
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-2>IFS</FONT></STRONG>
as separators.
The escape character,
<STRONG>&#0092;</STRONG>,
is used to remove any special meaning for the next
character and for line continuation.
The
<STRONG>&#45;d</STRONG>
option
causes the read to continue to the first character of
<EM>delim&nbsp;</EM>
rather than new-line.
The
<STRONG>&#45;n</STRONG>
option causes at most
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
bytes to read rather a full line
but will return when reading from a slow device
as soon as any characters have been read.
The
<STRONG>&#45;N</STRONG>
option causes exactly
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
to be read unless an end-of-file has been encountered or
the read times out because of the
<STRONG>&#45;t</STRONG>
option.
In raw mode,
<STRONG>&#45;r,</STRONG>
the
<STRONG>&#0092;</STRONG>
character is not treated specially.
The first
field is assigned to the first
<EM>vname</EM>,
the second field
to the second
<EM>vname</EM>,
etc., with leftover fields assigned to the last
<EM>vname</EM>.
When
<EM>vname</EM>
has the binary attribute and
<STRONG>&#45;n</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>&#45;N</STRONG>
is specified, the bytes that are read are stored directly
into the variable.
If the
<STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG>
is specified, then the value of the first
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
will be used as a default value when reading from a terminal device.
The
<STRONG>&#45;A</STRONG>
option causes the variable
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
to be unset and each field that is read to be stored in
successive elements of the indexed array
<EM>vname.</EM>
The
<STRONG>&#45;m</STRONG>
option reads a compound variable with the read method defined by
<EM>method</EM>.
Currently, only the
<STRONG>json</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>ksh</STRONG>
methods exist.
The
<STRONG>&#45;C</STRONG>
option causes the variable
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
to be read as a compound variable.  Blanks will be ignored when
finding the beginning open parenthesis.  This is equivalent to
<STRONG>&#45;m</STRONG>
<STRONG>ksh</STRONG>.
The &#45;S
option causes the line to be treated like a record in a
<STRONG>.csv</STRONG>
format file so that double quotes can be used to allow the delimiter
character and the new-line character to appear within a field.
The
<STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG>
option causes the input line
to be taken from the input pipe
of a process spawned by the shell
using
<STRONG>|&amp;</STRONG>.
If the
<STRONG>&#45;s</STRONG>
option is present,
the input will be saved as a command in the history file.
The option
<STRONG>&#45;u</STRONG>
can be used to specify a one digit file
descriptor unit
<EM>unit&nbsp;</EM>
to read from.
The file descriptor can be opened with the
<STRONG>exec&nbsp;</STRONG>
special built-in command.
The default value of unit
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is 0.
The option
<STRONG>&#45;t</STRONG>
is used to specify a timeout in
seconds when reading from a terminal or pipe.
If
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
is omitted, then
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>REPLY</STRONG></FONT>
is used as the default
<EM>vname</EM>.
An end-of-file with the
<STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG>
option causes cleanup for this process
so that another can be spawned.
If the first argument contains a
<STRONG>?</STRONG>,
the remainder of this word is used as a
<EM>prompt&nbsp;</EM>
on standard error
when the shell is interactive.
The exit status is 0 unless an end-of-file is encountered
or
<STRONG>read</STRONG>
has timed out.
<DT>&#167;&#167; <STRONG>readonly</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>vname</EM>&#0091;&nbsp;<STRONG>=</STRONG><EM>value&nbsp;</EM>&nbsp;&#0093; &nbsp;&#0093; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<DD><BR>
If
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
is not given,
the names and values of each variable with
the readonly attribute is printed with the values
quoted in a manner that allows them to be re-inputted.
The
<STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG>
option
causes the word
<STRONG>readonly</STRONG>
to be inserted before each one.
Otherwise, the given
<EM>vname</EM>s
are marked
readonly and these
names cannot be changed
by subsequent assignment.
When defining a type, if the value of a readonly sub-variable is not defined
the value is required when creating each instance.
<DT>&#167; <STRONG>return</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>n&nbsp;</EM> &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
Causes a shell
<EM>function</EM>
or
<STRONG>&nbsp;.</STRONG>
script to return
to the invoking script
with the exit status specified by
<EM>n</EM>.
The value will be the least significant 8 bits of the specified status.
If
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is omitted, then the return status is that of the last command executed.
If
<STRONG>return</STRONG>
is invoked while not in a
<EM>function</EM>
or a
<STRONG>&nbsp;.</STRONG>
script,
then it behaves the same as
<STRONG>exit</STRONG>.

The following list of attributes may be specified:
<DIV class=FI>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>&#45;A</STRONG><DD>
Declares
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
to be an associative array.
Subscripts are strings rather than arithmetic
expressions.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;C</STRONG><DD>
causes each
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
to be a compound variable.
<EM>value&nbsp;</EM>
names a compound variable it is copied into
<EM>vname</EM>.
Otherwise, it unsets each
<EM>vname</EM>.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;a</STRONG><DD>
Declares
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
to be an indexed array.
If
<EM>type&nbsp;</EM>
is specified, it must be the name of an enumeration
type created with the
<STRONG>enum</STRONG>
command and it allows enumeration constants to be used
as subscripts.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;E</STRONG><DD>
Declares
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
to be a double precision floating point number.
If
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is non-zero, it defines the number of significant figures
that are used when expanding
<EM>vname</EM>.
Otherwise, ten significant figures will be used.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;F</STRONG><DD>
Declares
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
to be a double precision floating point number.
If
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is non-zero, it defines the number of places after the
decimal point that are used when expanding
<EM>vname</EM>.
Otherwise ten places after the decimal point will be used.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;H</STRONG><DD>
This option provides UNIX to host-name file mapping on non-UNIX
machines.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;L</STRONG><DD>
Left justify and remove leading blanks from
<EM>value</EM>.
If
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is non-zero, it defines the width
of the field,
otherwise it is determined by the width of the value of
first assignment.
When the variable is assigned to, it is
filled on the right with blanks or truncated, if necessary, to
fit into the field.
The
<STRONG>&#45;R</STRONG>
option is turned off.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;M</STRONG><DD>
Use the character mapping
<EM>mapping&nbsp;</EM>
defined by
<NOBR><A href="../man3/wctrans.html"><EM>wctrans</EM></A>(3).</NOBR>
such as
<STRONG>tolower</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>toupper</STRONG>
when assigning a value to each of the specified operands.
When
<EM>mapping&nbsp;</EM>
is specified and there are not operands, all variables
that use this mapping are written to standard output.
When
<EM>mapping&nbsp;</EM>
is omitted and there are no operands, all mapped
variables are written to standard output.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;R</STRONG><DD>
Right justify and fill with leading blanks.
If
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is non-zero, it defines the width
of the field,
otherwise it is determined by the width of the value of
first assignment.
The field is left filled with blanks or
truncated from the end if the
variable is reassigned.
The
<STRONG>&#45;L</STRONG>
option is turned off.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;S</STRONG><DD>
When used within the
<EM>assign_list&nbsp;</EM>
of a type definition, it causes the specified sub-variable
to be shared by all instances of the type.
When used inside a function defined with the
<STRONG>function</STRONG>
reserved word, the specified variables will have
<EM>function static&nbsp;</EM>
scope.
Otherwise, the variable is unset prior to processing the assignment list.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;T</STRONG><DD>
If followed by <EM>tname&nbsp;</EM>, it
creates a type named by <EM>tname&nbsp;</EM> using the compound
assignment
<EM>assign_list&nbsp;</EM>
to <EM>tname</EM>.
Otherwise, it writes all the type definitions to standard output.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;X</STRONG><DD>
Declares
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
to be a double precision floating point number
and expands using the
<STRONG>%a</STRONG>
format of ISO-C99.
If
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is non-zero, it defines the number of hex digits after
the radix point that is used when expanding
<EM>vname</EM>.
The default is 10.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;Z</STRONG><DD>
Right justify and fill with leading zeros if
the first non-blank character is a digit and the
<STRONG>&#45;L</STRONG>
option has not been set.
Remove leading zeros if the
<STRONG>&#45;L</STRONG>
option is also set.
If
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is non-zero, it defines the width
of the field,
otherwise it is determined by the width of the value of
first assignment.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG><DD>
The names refer to function names rather than
variable names.
No assignments can be made and the only other
valid options are
<STRONG>&#45;S</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;t</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;u</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>&#45;x</STRONG>.
The &#45;S
can be used with discipline functions defined in a type to indicate that
the function is static.  For a static function, the same method will be used by all instances of that type no matter which instance references it.  In addition,
it can only use value of variables from the original type definition.  These
discipline functions cannot be redefined in any type instance.
The
<STRONG>&#45;t</STRONG>
option
turns on execution tracing for this function.
The
<STRONG>&#45;u</STRONG>
option
causes this function to be marked undefined.
The
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>FPATH</STRONG></FONT>
variable will be searched to find the function definition
when the function is referenced.
If no options other than
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>
is specified, then the function definition will be displayed
on standard output.  If
<STRONG>+f</STRONG>
is specified, then a line containing the function name followed
by a shell comment containing the line number and path name of the
file where this function was defined, if any, is displayed.
The exit status can be used to determine whether the function is
defined so that
<STRONG>typeset &#45;f .sh.math.</STRONG><EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
will return 0 when math function
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
is defined and non-zero otherwise.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;b</STRONG><DD>
The variable can hold any number of bytes of data.
The data can be text or binary.
The value is represented by the base64 encoding of the data.
If
<STRONG>&#45;Z</STRONG>
is also specified, the size in bytes of the
data in the buffer will be determined by the size associated with the
<STRONG>&#45;Z</STRONG>.
If the base64 string assigned results in more data, it will be
truncated.  Otherwise, it will be filled with bytes
whose value is zero.
The
<STRONG>printf</STRONG>
format
<STRONG>%B</STRONG>
can be used to output the actual data in this buffer instead
of the base64 encoding of the data.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;h</STRONG><DD>
Used within type definitions to add information when generating
information about the sub-variable on the man page.
It is ignored when used outside of a type definition.
When used with
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>
the information is associated with the corresponding discipline
function.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;i</STRONG><DD>
Declares
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
to be represented internally as integer.
The right hand side of an assignment is evaluated as an
arithmetic expression when assigning to an integer.
If
<EM>n&nbsp;</EM>
is non-zero, it defines the output arithmetic base,
otherwise the output base will be ten.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;l</STRONG><DD>
Used with
<STRONG>&#45;i</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;E</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>&#45;F</STRONG>,

<STRONG>&#45;u</STRONG>,
is turned off.
Equivalent to
<STRONG>&#45;M tolower .</STRONG>
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;m</STRONG><DD>
moves or renames the variable.
The value is the name of a variable whose value will be moved to
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>.
The original variable will be unset.
Cannot be used with any other options.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;n</STRONG><DD>
Declares
<EM>vname&nbsp;</EM>
to be a reference to the variable whose name is
defined by the value of variable
<EM>vname</EM>.
This is usually used to reference a variable inside
a function whose name has been passed as an argument.
Cannot be used with any other options.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG><DD>
The name, attributes and values for the given
<EM>vname</EM>s
are written on standard output in a form that can be
used as shell input.
If
<STRONG>+p</STRONG>
is specified, then the values are not displayed.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;r</STRONG><DD>
The given
<EM>vname</EM>s
are marked
readonly and these
names cannot be changed
by subsequent assignment.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;s</STRONG><DD>
Used with
<STRONG>&#45;i</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&#45;E</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>&#45;F</STRONG>,
to indicate short integer, or float.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;t</STRONG><DD>
Tags the variables.
Tags are user definable and have no special
meaning to the shell.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;u</STRONG><DD>
When given along with
<STRONG>&#45;i</STRONG>,
specifies unsigned integer.
Otherwise, all lower-case characters are converted
to upper-case.
The lower-case option,
<STRONG>&#45;l</STRONG>,
is turned off.
Equivalent to
<STRONG>&#45;M toupper .</STRONG>
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;x</STRONG><DD>
The given
<EM>vname</EM>s
are marked for automatic

<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>.
<P>
Using

to the complement of the previous umask value.
If
<EM>mask&nbsp;</EM>
is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.
The
<STRONG>&#45;S</STRONG>
option causes the mode to be printed as a symbolic
value.  Otherwise, the
mask is printed in octal.
The &#45;p
option cause the output to be in a form that can be use for reinput.
<DT>&#167; <STRONG>unalias</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;a</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; <EM>name&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<DD><BR>
The aliases
given by the list of
<EM>name</EM>s
are removed from the alias list.
The
<STRONG>&#45;a</STRONG>
option causes all the
aliases to be unset.
<DT>&#167;<STRONG>unset</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;fnv</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; <EM>vname&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<DD><BR>
The variables given by the list of
<EM>vname</EM>s
are unassigned,
i.e.,
except for sub-variables within a type,
their values and attributes are erased.
For sub-variables of a type, the values are reset to the
default value from the type definition.
Readonly variables cannot be unset.
If the
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>
option
is set, then the names refer to
<EM>function&nbsp;</EM>
names.
If the
<STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG>
option is set, then the names refer to
<EM>variable&nbsp;</EM>
names.
The
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>
option overrides
<STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG>.
If
<STRONG>&#45;n</STRONG>
is set and
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
is a name reference, then
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
will be unset rather than the variable
that it references.
The default is equivalent to
<STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG>.

<DT><STRONG>wait</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <EM>job&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#0093;<DD><BR>
Wait for the specified
<EM>job</EM>
and
report its termination status.
If
<EM>job&nbsp;</EM>
is not given, then all currently active child processes are waited for.
The exit status from this command is that of
the last process waited for if
<EM>job&nbsp;</EM>
is specified; otherwise it is zero.
See
<EM>Jobs</EM>
for a description of the format of
<EM>job</EM>.
<DT><STRONG>whence</STRONG> &#0091;&nbsp; <STRONG>&#45;afpv</STRONG> &nbsp;&#0093; <EM>name&nbsp;</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<DD><BR>
For each
<EM>name</EM>,
indicate how it
would be interpreted if used as a command name.
<P>
The
<STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG>
option
produces a more verbose report.
The
<STRONG>&#45;f</STRONG>
option skips the search for functions.
The
<STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG>
option
does a path search for
<EM>name&nbsp;</EM>
even if name is an alias, a function, or a reserved word.
The
<STRONG>&#45;p</STRONG>
option turns off the
<STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG>
option.
The
<STRONG>&#45;a</STRONG>
option
is similar to the
<STRONG>&#45;v</STRONG>
option but causes
all interpretations of the given name to be reported.

<H5><A name="Invocation">Invocation</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
If the shell is invoked by
<NOBR><A href="../man2/exec.html"><EM>exec</EM></A>(2),</NOBR>
and the first character of argument zero
(<STRONG>$0</STRONG>)
is
<STRONG>&#45;</STRONG>,
then the shell is assumed to be a
<EM>login</EM>
shell and
commands are read from
<STRONG>/etc/profile</STRONG>
and then from
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-1>$HOME</FONT>/.profile</STRONG>,
if it exists.
Alternatively, the option
<STRONG>&#45;l</STRONG>
causes the shell to a treated as a
<EM>login</EM>
shell.
Next, for interactive shells, commands are read from
the file named by
performing parameter expansion, command substitution,
and arithmetic substitution on
the value of the environment variable
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>ENV</STRONG></FONT>
if the file exists.
If the
<STRONG>&#45;s</STRONG>
option is not present and
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
and a file by the name of
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
exists, then it reads and executes this script.
Otherwise, if the first
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
does not contain a
<STRONG>/</STRONG>,
a path search is performed on the first
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
to determine the name of the script to execute.
The script
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
must have execute permission and any
<EM>setuid</EM>
and
<EM>setgid</EM>
settings will be ignored.
If the script is not found on the path,
<EM>arg&nbsp;</EM>
is processed as if it named a built-in command or function.
Commands are then read as described below;
the following options are interpreted by the shell
when it is invoked:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>&#45;D</STRONG><DD>
Do not execute the script, but output the set of double quoted strings
preceded by a
<STRONG>$</STRONG>.
These strings are needed for localization of the script to different locales.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;E</STRONG><DD>
Reads the file named by the
<STRONG>ENV</STRONG>
variable or by
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=-1>$HOME</FONT>/<STRONG>.</STRONG>kshrc</STRONG>
if not defined after the profiles.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;c</STRONG><DD>
If the
<STRONG>&#45;c</STRONG>
option is present, then
commands are read from the first
<EM>arg</EM>.
Any remaining arguments become
positional parameters starting at
<STRONG>0</STRONG>.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;s</STRONG><DD>
If the
<STRONG>&#45;s</STRONG>
option is present or if no
arguments remain,
then commands are read from the standard input.
Shell output,
except for the output of the
<EM>Special Commands&nbsp;</EM>
listed above,
is written to
file descriptor 2.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;i</STRONG><DD>
If the
<STRONG>&#45;i</STRONG>
option is present or
if the shell input and output are attached to a terminal (as told by
<NOBR><A href="../man2/tcgetattr.html"><EM>tcgetattr</EM></A>(2)),</NOBR>
then this shell is
<EM>interactive</EM>.
In this case <FONT SIZE=-1>TERM</FONT> is ignored (so that <STRONG>kill 0</STRONG>
does not kill an interactive shell) and <FONT SIZE=-1>INTR</FONT> is caught and ignored
(so that
<STRONG>wait</STRONG>
is ).
In all cases, <FONT SIZE=-1>QUIT</FONT> is ignored by the shell.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;r</STRONG><DD>
If the
<STRONG>&#45;r</STRONG>
option is present, the shell is a restricted shell.
<BR><DT><STRONG>&#45;D</STRONG><DD>
A list of all double quoted strings that are preceded by a
<STRONG>$</STRONG>
will be printed on standard output and the shell will exit.
This set of strings will be subject to language translation
when the locale is not C or POSIX.
No commands will be executed.
<DT><STRONG>&#45;P</STRONG><DD>
If
<STRONG>&#45;P</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>&#45;o profile</STRONG>
is present, the shell is a profile shell (see
<NOBR><A href="../man1/pfexec.html"><EM>pfexec</EM></A>(1)).</NOBR>
<DT><STRONG>&#45;R</STRONG><EM> filename&nbsp;</EM><DD><BR>
The
<STRONG>&#45;R</STRONG>
<EM>filename&nbsp;</EM>
option is used
to generate a cross reference database
that can be used by a separate utility
to find definitions and references for variables and commands.
</DL><P>
The remaining options and arguments are described under the
<STRONG>set</STRONG>
command above.
An optional
<STRONG>&#45;</STRONG>
as the first argument is ignored.
<P>
</DIV>
<H5><A name="Rksh Only">Rksh Only</A></H5>
<DIV class=FI>
<EM>Rksh</EM>
is used to set up login names and execution environments whose
capabilities are more controlled than those of the standard shell.
The actions of
<STRONG>rksh&nbsp;</STRONG>
are identical to those of
<STRONG>ksh&nbsp;</STRONG>,
except that the following are disallowed:
<DIV class=FI>
<P>
Unsetting the restricted option.
<BR>
changing directory (see
<NOBR><A href="../man1/cd.html"><EM>cd</EM></A>(1)),</NOBR>
<BR>
setting or unsetting the value or attributes of
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>SHELL</STRONG>,</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>ENV</STRONG>,</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>FPATH</STRONG>,</FONT>
or
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>PATH,</STRONG></FONT>
<BR>
specifying path or
command names containing
<STRONG>/</STRONG>,
<BR>
redirecting output
(<STRONG>&gt;</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&gt;|</STRONG>,
<STRONG>&lt;&gt;</STRONG>,
and
<STRONG>&gt;&gt;</STRONG>).
<BR>
adding or deleting built-in commands.
<BR>
using
<STRONG>command -p</STRONG>
to invoke a command.
</DIV>
<BR>
<P>
The restrictions above are enforced
after <STRONG>.profile</STRONG> and the
<FONT SIZE=-2><STRONG>ENV</STRONG></FONT>
files are interpreted.
<P>
When a command to be executed is found to be a shell procedure,
<STRONG>rksh&nbsp;</STRONG>
invokes
<EM>ksh&nbsp;</EM>
to execute it.
Thus, it is possible to provide to the end-user shell procedures
that have access to the full power of
the standard shell,
while imposing a limited menu of commands;
this scheme assumes that the end-user does not have write and
execute permissions in the same directory.
<P>
The net effect of these rules is that the writer of the
<STRONG>.profile</STRONG>
has complete control over user actions,
by performing guaranteed setup actions
and leaving the user in an appropriate directory
(probably
<EM>not&nbsp;</EM>
the login directory).
<P>
The system administrator often sets up a directory
of commands
(e.g.,
<STRONG>/usr/rbin</STRONG>)
that can be safely invoked by
<STRONG>rksh</STRONG>.
<P>
</DIV>
</DIV>
<H4><A name="EXIT STATUS">EXIT STATUS</A></H4>
<DIV class=FI>
Errors detected by the shell, such as syntax errors,
cause the shell
to return a non-zero exit status.
If the shell is being used non-interactively,
then execution of the shell file is abandoned
unless the error occurs inside a subshell in which case
the subshell is abandoned.
Otherwise, the shell returns the exit status of
the last command executed (see also the
<STRONG>exit</STRONG>
command above).
Run time errors detected by the shell are reported by
printing the command or function name and the error condition.
If the line number that the error occurred on is greater than one,
then the line number is also printed in square brackets
(<STRONG>&#0091;&#0093;</STRONG>)
after the command or function name.

If a command
is executed, and then a command with the same name is
installed in a directory in the search path before the directory where the
original command was found, the shell will continue to
<EM>exec&nbsp;</EM>
the original command.
Use the
<STRONG>&#45;t</STRONG>
option of the
<STRONG>alias&nbsp;</STRONG>
command to correct this situation.
<P>
Some very old shell scripts contain a
<STRONG>^</STRONG>
as a synonym for the pipe character
<STRONG>|</STRONG>.
<P>
Using the
<STRONG>hist&nbsp;</STRONG>
built-in command within a compound command will cause the whole
command to disappear from the history file.
<P>
The built-in command <STRONG>&nbsp;.</STRONG> <EM>file&nbsp;</EM>
reads the whole file before any commands are executed.
Therefore,
<STRONG>alias</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>unalias</STRONG>
commands in the file
will not apply to any commands defined in the file.
<P>
Traps are not processed while a job is waiting for a foreground process.
Thus, a trap on
<STRONG>CHLD</STRONG>
won't be executed until the foreground job terminates.
<P>
It is a good idea to leave a space after the comma operator in
arithmetic expressions to prevent the comma from being interpreted
as the decimal point character in certain locales.
